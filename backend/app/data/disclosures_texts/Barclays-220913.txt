ISS ESG ’s  VERIFICATION PROCESS  
ISS ESG is one of the world’s leading independent environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
research, analysis and rating houses. The company has been actively involved in the sustainable 
capital markets for over 25 years. Since 2014, ISS ESG has built up a reputation as a highly-reputed 
thought leader in the green and social bond market and has become one of the first CBI approved 
verifiers.  
ISS ESG has conducted this independent Pre-Issuance Verification of the green bond issued by 
Barclays based on the Climate Bonds Standard V.3. limited assurance procedures in accordance with 
relevant assurance standards such as the International Standard on Assurance Engagements, ISAE 
3000 revised - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. ISS ESG’s 
approach to assess whether the issuer’s Green Bond meets the criteria of the Climate Bonds 
Standard V.3. is as follows: 
▪ The issuer provided an overview over the assets to be included in the Green Bond asset pool and 
the relevant processes and documentation regarding the proceeds (e.g. use of proceeds, 
management of proceeds) to ISS ESG.  
▪ The issuer filled in a questionnaire that covers all criteria of the Climate Bonds Standard V.3. 
▪ The issuer provided background documents that elaborate further on the information 
mentioned in the questionnaire.  
▪ Using the questionnaire and background documents, ISS ESG carried out an assessment of the 
CBI criteria. In case any answers were unclear, ISS ESG contacted the issuer for more details and 
clarification. 
The engagement with Barclays took place in June – September 2022. 
ISS ESG ’s  BUSINESS PRACTICES  
ISS has conducted this verification in strict compliance with the ISS Code of Ethics, which lays out 
detailed requirements in integrity, transparency and objectivity for the ISS business and team 
members. It is designed to ensure that the verification is conducted independently and without any 
conflicts of interest with other parts of the ISS Group. 
RESTRICTION ON DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REPORT  
This Verification Report for Climate Bonds Certification including all documentation provided 
alongside is intended for the use of Barclays and the Climate Bonds Standard Board. The present 
document may be published by Barclays, CBI and ISS ESG. CBI and ISS ESG agree to publish the 
report with the consent of Barclays.

OPINION  
Based on the limited assurance procedures conducted and evidence obtained, nothing has come to 
our attention that causes us to believe that, in all material respects Barclays’s Green Bonds Program 
is not in conformance with the Climate Bonds Standard’s Pre-Issuance Requirements.

About ISS ESG  
ISS ESG is one of the world’s leading rating agencies in the field of sustainable investment. The 
agency analyses companies and countries regarding their environmental and social performance.  
We assess alignment with external principles (e.g. the ICMA Green / Social Bond Principles), analyse 
the sustainability quality of the assets and review the sustainability performance of the issuer 
themselves. Following these three steps, we draw up an independent SPO so that investors are as 
well informed as possible about the quality of the bond / loan from a sustainability perspective.

The assets have been designed using 
MetOcean data, which explicitly considers 
the impact of parameters such as rising sea 
levels and storm surges. 
Also, the Project has insurance policies to 
cover potential damage from adverse 
weather such as lightning and storm surges, 
- ensuring the assets can be repaired and 
continue to operate following an adverse 
weather event. 
The regulatory approvals confirms that the 
project has taken the appropriate

Processes are in place to 
assess improvements and 
impacts the assets have on 
the resilience of other 
stakeholders  
The regulatory approvals require that the 
project take due consideration on its 
impacts on other stakeholders, during both 
the planning and operational stages. This 
includes extensive consultation with local 
communities and fisheries.  
 
3.1 
An adaptation plan has been 
designed and is being 
implemented to address the

The assets or projects do not 
put at risk or endangered 
species or habitat or unduly 
impact ecosystem services. 
Where there are possible 
negative impacts to habitats,
