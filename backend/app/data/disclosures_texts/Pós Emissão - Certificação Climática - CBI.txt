1. ENGAGEMENT SUMMARY  
The purpose of this Report is to provide a Post -Issuance Verification for the Fifth Issuance of 
Non-convertible Debentures (“Bond”) issued by Aliança Geração de Energia S.A.  (Issuer) as a 
Certified Climate Bond. This issuance was the second Climate Bond of Aliança Geração de Energia 
S.A. 
The issuance occurred on May 2022 and amounted to BRL 240 ,000,000.00. In 2022, SITAWI's 
sustainable finance program, which became NINT and was acquired by ERM in 2023 (“Approved 
Verifier”), conducted the Pre-Issuance Verification assessment, as an independent th ird-party 
provider accredited by the Climate Bonds Standards Board. 
The proceeds from the issuance were used  to finance and reimburse expenses  related to the 
implementation of the Complexo Eólico Gravier project and the Complexo Eólico Acauã project  
(“Nominated Projects & Assets”). The Gravier project was developed to generate electricity from 
renewable and clean source, utilizing the wind potential of the state of Ceará, specifically in the 
municipality of Icapuí. The Acauã project was implemented in the municipalities of Santana dos 
Matos, Lagoa Nova, Tenente Laurentino a nd São Vicente, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. 
Both projects are located in Brazil. 
ERM’s assessment method follows the Climate Bonds Standards, Version 4.11. The assessment 
followed the Climate Bond Initiative (CBI)’s general requirements (applicable to all bonds) and 
the Wind Sector Eligibility Criteria of the Climate Bonds Standard & Certification Scheme Version 
2.3 under the Climate Bonds Standard (April 2023)2. 
The assessment process consisted of the following: 
• Planning the assessment; 
• Risk assessment; 
• Performing the assessment, including client preparation, obtaining evidence and 
practitioner assessment; 
• Forming the assessment conclusion; 
• Preparing the assessment report; 
• Submission for CBI certification 
 
The assessment relied on both confidential and public information and documents provided by 
Aliança Geração de  Energia S.A., desk research and remote interviews conducted with the 
sustainability and finance areas. This process was carried out in August and September 2024. 
 
The assessment process was performed under relevant general principles & professional 
standards of independent auditing and in line with the International Standard on Assessment 
Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000), 
International Standard in Quality Control (ISQC 1, 2009) and Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants of International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA, 2019). 
The professionals that performed this assessment have previous knowledge and experience on 
applying Climate Bonds Standard version 4.1 and Climate Bond Sector Criteria and are familiar 
with the sector’s main ESG risks and opportunities.

DATE: 02 September 2024  Page 2 
ERM had access to all documents and professionals requested,  including reports, financial 
statements, and licenses.  However, due to the lack of detailed financial statements,  ERM was 
able to provide an  assessment with a limited3 level of assurance regarding completeness, 
accuracy, and reliability. 
ERM is not a shareholder, subsidiary, supplier or client of Aliança Geração de Energia. SITAWI's 
sustainable finance program, which began operating as NINT in 2023 and was acquired by ERM 
in 2023, was responsible for preparing a Pre-Issuance and a Post-Issuance CBI Verification 
Report, as well as an Independent Pre-Issuance Verification Opinion in 2021 for Aliança Geração 
de Energia. In 2022, NINT prepared a CBI Pre-Issuance Verification Report and an Independent 
Pre-Issuance Verification Opinion. In 2023, another CBI Pre-Issuance Verification Report and an 
Independent Pre-Issuance Verification Opinion were prepared for the Company. 
The assessment contained in this Report is based on both public and confidential documents 
provided by Aliança. We cannot attest to these sources’ completeness, preciseness, or reliability. 
Therefore, ERM will not be held responsible for any decisions based upon the information in this 
report provided to us by these sources that turn out to be incomplete, inaccurate, or unreliable. 
ERM is responsible for providing an external and independent assessment of the conformance of 
the Framework with the Climate Bonds Standard version 4.1 requirements and associated 
sector-specific technical criteria. We reinforce that the analysis and opini on in this report shall 
not be taken as an investment recommendation or a proxy for liquidity or returns.  
 
3 “An assurance engagement in which the practitioner reduces engagement risk to a level that is acceptable in the 
circumstances of the engagement but where that risk is greater than for a reasonable assurance engagement as the 
basis for expressing a conclusio n in a form that conveys whether, based on the procedures performed and evidence 
obtained, a matter(s) has come to the practitioner’s attention to cause the practitioner to believe the subject matter 
information is materially misstated. The nature, timing, and extent of procedures performed in a limited assurance  
engagement is limited compared with that necessary in a reasonable assurance engagement but is planned to obtain a 
level of assurance that is, in the practitioner’s professional judgment, meaningful. To be meaningful, the level of 
assurance obtained by the  practitioner is likely to enhance the intended users’ confidence about the subject matter 
information to a degree that is clearly more than inconsequential” (ISAE 3000, 2013).

2. ASSESSMENT STATEMENT  
 
Based on the limited assurance procedures conducted and evidence obtained, nothing has come 
to our attention that causes us to believe that, in all material respects, the Second Climate Bond 
Issuance of Aliança Geração de Energia S.A. issued in 2022  is not in conformance with the 
Climate Bonds Standard’s Post-Issuance Requirements.

All the Nominated Projects & Assets that received allocations of green bond funds were fully in 
accordance with the wind sector criteria. 
3.1.1.6 THE ISSUER MUST ALLOCATE THE NET PROCEEDS TO THE NOMINATED PROJECTS AND 
ASSETS WITHIN 24 MONTHS OF ISSUANCE OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENT. THE 24 -
MONTH DEADLINE CAN BE EXTENDED BY THE CLIMATE BONDS STANDARD 
SECRETARIAT FOR UP TO 5 YEARS (AND EXCEPTIONALLY UP TO 1 0 YEARS IF DULY 
JUSTIFIED BY THE NATURE OF THE PROJECTS TO BE FINANCED). AN EXTENSION WILL 
BE GRANTED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE CLIMATE BONDS STANDARD SECRETARIAT, 
PROVIDED THE JUSTIFICATION FOR IT CAN BE SUBSTANTIATED BY THE ISSUER AND 
CONFIRMED BY THE APPROVED VERIFIER. AT THE END OF THE ALLOCATION PERIOD 
SPECIFIED IN THE CERTIFICATION, THE ISSUER MUST PROVIDE A POST -ISSUANCE 
VERIFICATION REPORT BY AN APPROVED VERIFIER. THE ISSUER MAY BE REQUESTED 
TO PROVIDE ANNUAL POST-ISSUANCE VERIFICATION REPORTS UNTIL THE APPROVED 
VERIFIER CONFIRMS THAT 100% OF THE PROCEEDS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED. 
The company has allocated 100% of the net proceeds to the Nominated Project within 24 months 
of the issuance, as evidenced by the 2022 and 2023 audited Financial Statements sent by 
Aliança.  
There was no extension requested on the 24-month deadline. 
Furthermore, Aliança has published its Sustainability Report6 and Financial Statements7 annually, 
containing information regarding the projects financed.  
3.1.1.7 THE NET PROCEEDS MAY BE REALLOCATED TO OTHER NOMINATED PROJECTS AND 
ASSETS AT ANY TIME WHILE THE DEBT INSTRUMENT REMAINS OUTSTANDING, 
PROVIDED THE APPROVED VERIFIER HAS VERIFIED SUCH ASSETS. 
The net proceeds were entirely allocated to the nominated project listed in item 3.1.1. 1. No 
other project received funding from the issuance. The projects were considered a priority by the 
Ministry of Regional Development, in accordance with Brazilian Law 12,431/2011. 
3.1.1.8 NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS MUST NOT BE NOMINATED TO OTHER CERTIFIED 
DEBT INSTRUMENTS, UNLESS THE ISSUER DEMONSTRATES THAT DIFFERENT 
CERTIFIED CLIMATE BONDS ARE FUNDING DISTINCT PORTIONS OF THE NOMINATED 
PROJECTS AND ASSETS, OR THE CERTIFIED DEBT INSTRUM ENT IS BEING 
REFINANCED VIA ANOTHER CERTIFIED DEBT INSTRUMENT. 
In addition to the climate bond that is the subject of this verification, another climate operation  
(4th debenture issuance of Aliança Energia) financed the Gravier Complex. This operation had its 
structure previously assessed by SITAWI in an Independent Pre-Issuance Verification Opinion 
and took place in April 2022. One hundred and ninety million reais ( BRL190,000,000.00) were 
allocated to the project. It is important to note that this issuance also received certification from 
the CBI.

REFINANCING OPERATING EXPENDITURES THAT WERE INCURRED WITHIN THREE 
YEARS PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE CERTIFIED DEBT INSTRUMENT. 
From the total proceeds of the bond issuance, approximately BRL101,000,000.00 (one hundred 
and one million reais) was allocated to reimburse expenses incurred on the Gravier Project and 
BRL5,500,000.00 (five million, five hundred thousand reais) was allocated to reimburse 
expenses incurred on the Ac auã Project, totaling BRL106,500,000.00 (one hundred and six 
million, five hundred thousand reais). This amount corresponds to 44% of the total issuance. 
The remaining amount, corresponding to BRL133,500,000.00 (one hundred and thirty -three 
million, five hundred thousand reais), was allocated to future project expenses. Of this total, 
BRL89,000,000.00 (eighty -nine million reais) was earmarked for the Gravie r Wind Complex, 
between April and June 2022 . About B RL44,500,000.00 (forty -four million, five hundred 
thousand reais) for the Acauã Wind Complex, between April 2022 and October 2023, including 
the costs of the Transition Line. The amount allocated to future expenses corresponded to 56% 
of the total value of the issuance.

3.1.1.10 THE ISSUER MUST TRACK THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENT 
FOLLOWING A FORMAL INTERNAL PROCESS WHICH IS DOCUMENTED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH CLAUSE A.3.3. 
Aliança ring-fenced the proceeds to Central Eólica Gravier S.A. SPV, as well as to Central Eólica 
Acauã I S.A. SPV, Central Eólica Acauã II S.A. SPV, and Central Eólica Acauã III S.A. SPV.  
Initially, the funds were deposited into Aliança’s current account, responsible for allocating them 
to the eligible projects. Subsequently, the portion earmarked for future expenditures was 
transferred to Central Eólica Gravier S.A. SPV, Central Eólica Aca uã I S.A. SPV, Central Eólica 
Acauã II S.A. SPV, and Central Eólica Acauã III S.A. SPV through capital contributions. The 
portion designated for reimbursement was transferred to Aliança’s account (Issuer), which 
contributed amounts equivalent to those prev iously paid for the execution of the projects. ERM 
verified this process through the 2022 and 2023 Financial Statements.  
Therefore, it is possible to conclude that Aliança monitored the net proceeds following a formal 
internal process. 
3.1.1.11 THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENT MUST BE NO GREATER THAN THE 
ISSUER’S TOTAL INVESTMENT EXPOSURE OR DEBT OBLIGATION TO THE NOMINATED 
PROJECTS AND ASSETS OR THE RELEVANT PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL MARKET 
VALUE OF THE NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS WHICH A RE OWNED OR 
FINANCED BY THE ISSUER. WHEN SATISFYING THIS CLAUSE, THE ISSUER MAY

CHOOSE EITHER (I) THE INVESTMENT EXPOSURE OR DEBT OBLIGATION TO THE 
NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS, OR (II) THEIR MARKET VALUE. 
According to Aliança, the total investment costs of the Gravier - BRL 428,000,000.00 - and Acauã 
- BRL 728,000,000.00 - projects remained unchanged from the 2022 estimates presented in the 
Independent Pre-issuance Verification Opinion. Therefore, as shown in Table 4, the value of the 
projects exceeds the proceeds raised by the 5th bond issuance, thus there were no unallocated 
green proceeds.

I. A STATEMENT ON THE CLIMATE-RELATED OBJECTIVES OF THE BOND.  
The main environmental benefit of renewable energy generation is associated with the reduction 
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the electricity sector. The energy sector has a significant 
role to play in combating climate change in Brazil, with the potential to reduce emissions by 
1,221.4 million tCO₂ by 2050 and is essential to achieving Brazil’s NDC. 
Based on the evidence assessed , the Bond is in conformance, in all material 
respects, with the ‘Use of Proceeds’ portion of the Post -Issuance Certification 
Requirements.

II. HOW THE CLIMATE-RELATED OBJECTIVES OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENT ARE 
POSITIONED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE ISSUER’S OVERARCHING 
GOALS, STRATEGY, POLICY AND/OR PROCESSES RELATING TO 
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY.  
III. THE ISSUER’S RATIONALE FOR ISSUING THE DEBT INSTRUMENT.  
The Issuer’s social object as defined by its bylaws is the economic and commercial exploitation 
of energy generation systems, consulting services and participation in other electric power 
generation companies or ventures. Currently, the company operates on ly renewable energy 
projects in Brazil. 
The Issuer has a formalized Environmental Policy that includes guidelines and commitment to 
environmental issues, which is also applied to its subsidiaries, controlled companies and/or 
consortia. The environmental management of the Gravier Wind Complex  and Acauã Wind 
Complex is held by Aliança’s dedicated team. Moreover, Aliança has an internal Environmental 
Legislation Control and Assessment System, which provides registers the status of 
environmental licenses, authorizations and conditions. 
The bond’s indenture also contains early termination clauses to prevent changes in the scope of 
the project or in the use of the proceeds to ensure compliance with applicable social and 
environmental legislation throughout the life cycle of the project. It is important to note that the 
bond falls under the Brazilian category of " Incentivized Infrastructure Bonds", as the project to 
be financed is classified as a priority project by the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy. As a 
result, the bond will also have to comply with the provisions of Law 12,431/11 in order not to 
lose the benefits of the special tax treatment. 
 
8 The energy production data presented by Aliança for the eligible projects correspond to the following 
periods: Gravier Wind Complex – production from June 2023 to May 2024; Acauã Wind Complex (Acauã II 
– production from December 2023 to May 2024; Acauã III – from August 2023 to May 2024; Acauã I – no 
production data available due to the start of commercial operations in July 2024). 
9 The avoided GHG emissions were calculated using the methodology 'Tool to calculate the emission factor 
for an electricity system.' This methodology is used in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects and 
involves the combination of two components: the op erating margin emission factor, reflecting the CO2 
emission intensity of the dispatched energy at the margin, and the build margin emission factor, which 
reflects the emission intensity of the most recently built power plants. This calculation is carried o ut in 
accordance with the methodology approved by the CDM Executive Board and is used to quantify the 
contribution of a new power plant to reducing CO2 emissions compared to a baseline scenario.

Considering the points, the climate-related objectives of the Bond are aligned with Aliança core 
business and strategy. 
IV. A PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE NOMINATED PROJECTS AND 
ASSETS MEET THE SECTOR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED OF THE 
STANDARD.  
ERM has assessed the Nominated Projects and Assets under the Wind Sector Eligibility Criteria 
of the Climate Bonds Standard and concluded that the issuance complied with all material 
aspects described in the Wind Sector Criteria of the Climate Bonds Standard (Version 4.1). 
• Climate Bonds Taxonomy: The Nominated Projects & Assets fall into the “Wind” 
under “Energy” investment area as included in the Climate Bonds Taxonomy10. 
• Sector Eligibility Criteria: The Nominated Projects & Assets meet the specific  
eligibility requirements provided in the Wind Sector Eligibility Criteria document.  
The clause 3.8.1 of the Bond’s indenture states that the issuance’s proceeds would be directed 
to Gravier Wind Complex and to Acauã Wind Complex . Therefore, the Nominated Project meet 
the CBI eligibility criteria and fall into the investment areas above. Therefore, ERM concluded 
that the projects remain in conformance with the requirements specified by the Standard 4.1. 
V. OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE ISSUER AS DESCRIBED IN CLAUSE 
A.2.2.  
The eligible project s were defined prior to the issuance. As stated by the Issuer, there is an 
internal process and dedicated employee to manage environmental and social risks. The 
Nominated Project s had their environmental conditions and licenses checked for validity and 
terms by ERM. 
Besides, the Bond’s indenture points out the obligation to follow environmental and social 
legislation. Some of the issues explicitly cited are prohibition of slavery -like labor, child labor, 
race and gender discrimination. In addition, environmental protection and health and safety 
aspects are also specified. The indenture sets early termination clause in case of non-compliance. 
ERM has conducted an in -depth assessment on the environmental and social management 
aspect of the eligible projects and assets. It has concluded that the project has a comfortable 
E&S management system in place. 
 
 
3.1.3 MANAGEMENT OF PROCEEDS  
3.1.3.1 THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS MUST BE CREDITED TO A SUB -
ACCOUNT, MOVED TO BE A SUB-PORTFOLIO, OR OTHERWISE IDENTIFIED BY THE 
ISSUER IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER AND DOCUMENTED.  
The named projects are linked to their respective Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), separate legal 
entities for the development of the projects. The proceeds were kept in the issuer's central 
account and transferred to the SPVs' sub -account, allowing the fund s to be properly tracked. 
 
10 CBI_Taxonomy_Tables-08A (1).pdf (climatebonds.net) 
Base on the  evidence assessed, the Bond is in conformance, in all material 
respects, with the ‘Process for Evaluation and Selection of Projects and Assets’ 
portion of the Post-Issuance Certification Requirements

CLIENT: Aliança Geração de Energia S.A.  
DATE: 02 September 2024  Page 12 
This information could be verified through the company's Financial Statements (2022 and 2023), 
which are publicly available on the company's investor relations website.  
Therefore, ERM considers that Aliança has identified the allocation of proceeds in an appropriate 
and documented manner. 
3.1.3.2 THE DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUER MUST EITHER MAINTAIN AN EARMARKING PROCESS 
OR RINGREFERENCE THE PROCEEDS PER CLAUSE A.2.3 TO MANAGE AND ACCOUNT 
FOR THE ALLOCATION OF NET PROCEEDS TO THE NOMINATED PROJECTS AND 
ASSETS. 
As mentioned before, the named projects are associated with their respective Special Purpose 
Vehicles (SPVs), which are distinct legal entities created for the purpose of project development. 
The proceeds were initially deposited into the issuer's central account and subsequently 
transferred to  the SPVs' sub -accounts, enabling accurate tracking of the funds. This can be 
confirmed by reviewing the company's publicly available Financial Statements for 2022 and 
2023, accessible on its investor relations website. Consequently, ERM considers that Aliança has 
properly and documented the allocation of proceeds.  
3.1.3.3 WHILE IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS REMAINS OUTSTANDING, THE BALANCE OF THE 
TRAKED NET PROCEEDS MUST BE REDUCED BY AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO NOMINATED 
PROJECTS AND ASSETS. PENDING SUCH ALLOCATIONS TO NOMINATED PROJECTS 
AND ASSETS, THE BALANCE OF UNALLOCATED NET PROCEEDS MUST BE: 
i. Held in temporary investment instruments that are cash, money-
market instruments or other liquid, short-term cash equivalent 
instruments within a Treasury function; and/or 
ii. Held in temporary investment instruments that do not relate to 
greenhouse gas intensive projects or any projects which are 
inconsistent with the delivery of a low carbon and climate resilient 
economy; and/or 
iii. Applied to temporarily reduce the indebtedness of a revolving nature 
before being redrawn for investments in or disbursements to 
Nominated projects and assets. 
The proceeds were fully allocated to the eligible projects  between 2022 and 2023 . While the 
proceeds were not fully allocated to the eligible projects, they were invested substantially in 
Bank Deposit Certificates (Certificados de Depósito Bancário (CDB), in Portuguese) from private

banks, a financial instrument of high liquidity and low risk of default, as evidenced by the 2022 
and 2023 Aliança’s Financial Statement.  
Therefore, the unallocated net proceeds were withheld  in temporary investments instruments 
that have high liquidity and do not include greenhouse gas-intensive projects. 
3.1.4 POST-ISSUANCE REPORTIN G 
3.1.4.1 FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE UOP INSTRUMENT, TO MAINTAIN THE 
CERTIFICATION ALL ISSUERS MUST SUBMIT ANNUAL UPDATE REPORTS WITHIN 12 TO 
24 MON THS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENT UNTIL ITS 
MATURITY. ANY POST-ISSUANCE VERIFICATION REPORT BY AN APPROVED VERIFIER IN 
ANY YEAR IS DEEMED TO SATISFY THE ISSUER’S REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT AN UPDATE 
REPORT FOR THAT YEAR. 
The issuer is committed to preparing a report with information about the allocation of proceeds 
and the environmental benefits to reaffirm the transaction's compliance with the Climate Bonds 
Standard. However, it was verified that the Company has not made available an updated report 
in accordance with CBI standards. 
Nevertheless, in 2023, Aliança published the company's Annual Sustainability Report, available 
on the company's website, which provided information on the projects financed, as well as their 
installed capacity, completion date and geographical location. In addition, in the audited Financial 
Statements for 2022 and 2023, the company presents the status of the allocation of net 
proceeds, confirming that 100% of these funds have been allocated to the indicated project.  
3.1.4.2 THE ISSUER SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE AN UPDATE REPORT ON A TIMELY BASIS IN CASE 
OF MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTS . MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT 
LIMITED TO, EARLY REPAYMENT, CHANGE OF CONTROL OR ACQUISITION, CHANGE OF 
NAME, CHANGES TO THE ELIGIBILITY OF ASSETS AND PROJECTS AND ANY MATERIAL 
AMENDMENTS TO TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING ANY WINDING-UP PROCESS 
OR ENFORCEMENT. 
There were no material developments involving the issuance nor the projects financed. 
3.1.4.3 ISSUERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE THEIR UPDATE REPORTS THROUGH EXISTING 
BOND MARKET REPORTING CHANNELS, SUCH AS THE US MUNICIPALITY SECTOR’S 
ELECTRONIC MUNICIPAL MARKET ACCESS (EMMA) WEBSITE.  
Aliança did not provide Update Reports following the CBI's Update Report template through 
any bond market reporting channels.  
Based on the limited assurance procedures conducted and evidence obtained, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, in all material 
respects the Issuer’s 2022 Climate Bond is not in conformance with the Climate 
Bonds Standard’s Post-Issuance Requirements.  
However, it is worth noting that the company's expenses in the financial 
statements are not segregated monthly - making it not possible to confirm the 
total allocation of the proceeds raised monthly. In addition, Aliança committed to 
sending the Trustee a declaration attesting to the allocation of the proceeds of 
the issuance after the total amount of the proceeds had been allocated. Despite 
this, it was verified the documents attesting to the correct allocation of the 
proceeds have not yet been sent to the Trustee.

CLIENT: Aliança Geração de Energia S.A.  
DATE: 02 September 2024  Page 14 
3.1.4.4 AN UPDATE REPORT MAY CONTAIN THREE TYPES OF REPORTING: ALLOCATION 
REPORTING, ELIGIBILITY REPORTING, AND IMPACT REPORTING:  
I. ALLOCATION REPORTING CONFIRMS THE ALLOCATION OF BOND PROCEEDS 
TO ELIGIBLE PROJECTS AND ASSETS AND IS MANDATORY FOR ALL CERTIFIED 
DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  
II. ELIGIBILITY REPORTING CONFIRMS THE CHARACTERISTICS OR 
PERFORMANCE OF PROJECTS AND ASSETS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR 
ELIGIBILITY UNDER THE RELEVANT SECTOR CRITERIA AND IS MANDATORY 
FOR ALL CERTIFIED DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  
III. IMPACT REPORTING DISCLOSES THE METRICS OR INDICATORS WHICH 
REFLECT THE EXPECTED OR ACTUAL IMPACT OF ELIGIBLE PROJECTS AND 
ASSETS AND IS ENCOURAGED FOR ALL CERTIFIED DEBT INSTRUMENTS. 
Both allocation and impact reporting were covered by Aliança through its 202 2 and 202 3 
Financial Statements and Sustainability Report, while eligibility criteria was included in the 
Second-Party Opinion Pre -Issuance developed by SITAWI in 2022 and confirmed in the Post -
Issunace Report developed in 202 4. The first three documents are available on the Aliança’s 
website. 
It is important to reinforce that the reporting did not comply with CBI’s Update Report template. 
In other words, although Aliança has reported part of the environmental indicators and 
information on proceeds allocation, it did not follow the CBI’s Update Report template. 
3.1.4.5 THE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF REPORTING CAN BE INCLUDED IN A SINGLE UPDATE 
REPORT, WHICH MUST BE PROVIDED TO THE CLIMATE BONDS STANDARD 
SECRETARIAT AND MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE OR PROVIDED ANNUALLY TO THE 
BONDHOLDERS/LENDERS FOR AS LONG AS THE DEBT INSTRUMEN T REMAINS 
OUTSTANDING. 
At the time of this verification, Aliança Geração de Energia had not sent the updated report to 
the CBI. 
3.1.4.6 THE TIMING OF REPORTING UNDER THIS CLAUSE CAN BE ALIGNED WITH THE 
ISSUER’S REGULAR REPORTING SCHEDULE AND DOES NOT NEED TO FOLLOW THE 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE CERTIFICATION OR ISSUANCE OF THE BOND. 
The timing of reporting was not aligned with the anniversary of the issuance of the Bond, as it 
followed the issuer’s regular reporting schedule. 
3.1.4.7 THE ALLOCATION REPORTING MUST INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION:  
I. CONFIRMATION THAT THE BONDS ISSUED UNDER THE ISSUER’S GREEN 
FINANCE FRAMEWORK ARE ALIGNED WITH THE CLIMATE BONDS STANDARD.  
II. A STATEMENT ON THE CLIMATE-RELATED OBJECTIVES OF THE BOND. 
III. THE LIST OF NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS TO WHICH NET PROCEEDS 
HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED (OR RE-ALLOCATED). 
IV. THE AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO THE NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS. 
V. AN ESTIMATE OF THE RESPECTIVE SHARES OF THE NET PROCEEDS USED 
FOR FINANCING AND REFINANCING AND WHICH NOMINATED PROJECTS AND 
POST-ISSUANCE VERIFICATION REPORT  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
 
CLIENT: Aliança Geração de Energia S.A.

ASSETS HAVE BEEN REFINANCED. THIS MAY ALSO INCLUDE THE EXPECTED 
LOOK-BACK PERIOD FOR REFINANCING NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS. 
VI. THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE NOMINATED PROJECTS AND 
ASSETS. 
3.1.4.8 THE ELIGIBILITY REPORTING MUST INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION:  
I. CONFIRMATION THAT THE NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS CONTINUE TO 
MEET THE RELEVANT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE WHEN 
OBTAINING THE CERTIFICATION.  
II. INFORMATION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OR 
PERFORMANCE OF NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS, WHICH IS 
PRESCRIBED BY THE RELEVANT SECTOR CRITERIA.  
III. WHERE THE ISSUER HAS MADE USE OF THE 5% FLEXIBILITY POCKET IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH A.3.1.3, THE PERCENTAGE OF THE USE OF 
PROCEEDS ALLOCATED TO, AND DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF, THE NOMINATED 
PROJECTS AND ASSETS WHICH DO NOT FULLY SATISFY THE SECTOR CRITERIA. 
As previously mentioned, all of the items were included either on the Sustainability Report, or 
on the 2023 Financial Statement, or in the bond’s indenture. However, any specific Allocation 
Reporting, following CBI’s Update Report template, was performed. 
3.1.4.9 SOME BONDS HAVE A VERY STABLE ALLOCATION OF PROCEEDS AND DO NOT NEED 
TO TRACK ANY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO MAINTAIN THE ELIGIBILITY OF THE 
PROJECTS AND ASSETS (SUCH AS FINANCING FOR A SINGLE LARGE -SCALE SOLAR 
FACILITY). THIS MEANS THAT THE ANNUAL UPDATE R EPORT CAN BE CONCISE AND 
RESTATE THE INFORMATION FROM PREVIOUS REPORTS. 
3.1.4.10 WHERE THERE ARE LIMITS ON THE DETAIL THAT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE IN THE 
UPDATE REPORT ABOUT SPECIFIC NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS (AS PER 
CLAUSE A.2.4.3), INFORMATION DISCLOSED MUST INCLUDE THE INVESTMENT AREAS 
INTO WHICH THE NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS FALL AND AN EXPLANATION 
OF WHY DETAIL ON NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS IS LIMITED. 
There was no limitation on the level of detail provided from Aliança. 
3.1.4.11 THE IMPACT REPORTING SHALL, WITHOUT LIMITATION: I. PROVIDE THE EXPECTED 
OR ACTUAL OUTCOMES OR IMPACTS OF THE NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS 
CONCERNING THE CLIMATE -RELATED OBJECTIVES OF THE BOND. II. USE 
QUALITATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND, WHERE FEASIBLE , QUANTITATIVE 
PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF THE OUTCOMES OR IMPACTS OF THE NOMINATED 
PROJECTS AND ASSETS FOR THE CLIMATE -RELATED OBJECTIVES OF THE BOND. III. 
PROVIDE THE METHODS AND THE KEY UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE 
CALCULATION OF THE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND METRICS. 
3.1.4.12 EXAMPLES OF QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF THE OUTCOMES OF 
NOMINATED PROJECTS AND ASSETS CAN INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: 
RENEWABLE ENERGY CAPACITY INSTALLED, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AVOIDED, 
EMISSIONS INTENSITY, ENERGY PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS, NUMBER OF 
PASSENGERS CARRIED BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT, VOLUME OF WASTEWATER TREATED. 
IMPACT METRICS AND INDICATORS CAN INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: 
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCED/AVOIDED, THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS

CALCULATIONS. BOTH INSTITUTIONAL AND PROPRIETARY FRAMEWORKS MAY BE 
USED: INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS MAY BE REFERENCED BY  NAME, BUT 
PROPRIETARY AND NEW FRAMEWORKS SHOULD BE DESCRIBED IN SUFFICIENT 
DETAIL TO ALLOW ASSESSMENT 
As previously stated, Aliança has provided the impact metric of renewable energy capacity 
installed on its 2023 Sustainability Report. Also, Aliança has provided to ERM power generation 
reports proving the project’s power generation between Juny 2023 and July 2024. This data has 
been published externally  on its 2023 Financial Statement reports . However, any specific 
Impacting Reporting, following CBI’s Update Report template, was performed. 
3.1.4.14 THE ISSUER MUST MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC OR TO THE BONDHOLDERS ANY 
VERIFICATION REPORTS OR OTHER RELEVANT MATERIAL WHICH SUPPORTS THE 
UPDATE REPORT. 
Aliança has informed about the CBI certification 11 on its website, as well as made available the 
SPO elaborated by SITAWI in 202 212. The company also publishes its audited Financial 
Statements and Sustainability Reports annually. 
 
3.2  THE WIND SECTOR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA OF THE CLIMATE BONDS 
STANDARD & CERTIFICATION SCHEME VERSION 2.3 (APRIL 2023) 
ASSESSMENT  
The following assessment is based on the Part C of the Climate Bonds Standards Version 4.0, 
namely the Eligibility of Projects & Assets. It is organized according to the items listed in the 
Wind Energy under the Climate Bonds Standard provided by CBI. The Sectoral Criteria 
Requirements are listed, followed by each requirement’s factual findings. The section is 
concluded with ERM’s assessment conclusion. 
Criteria 1 - Eligible Project & Assets relating to wind energy generation shall be 
projects or assets that operate or are under construction to operate in one or more of 
the following activities: 
1. Onshore wind energy generation facilities. 
2. Dedicated transmission infrastructure and support facilities (e.g. transformers, 
backbone, transmission terminus, grid connections, dedicated facilities for 
support vessels and vehicles, equipment storage, onshore assembly). 
 
11 CBI Certification 
12 SPO 2022 
Based on the limited assurance procedures conducted and evidence obtained, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, in all material 
respects the Issuer’s 2022 Climate Bond is not in conformance with the Climate 
Bonds Standard’s Post-Issuance Requirements. Nevertheless, Aliança has not yet 
provided an updated report according to CBI Standards, as it had committed to.

DATE: 02 September 2024  Page 17 
3. Dedicated operational production, manufacturing or distribution facilities for 
key components for onshore or offshore wind energy generation, such as wind 
turbines, platforms etc.  
Since 100% of the net proceeds were allocated in the development, construction and operation 
of onshore wind electricity generation facilities, where all the energy generated comes from wind 
energy resources, it is feasible to state that the projects finan ced remain in conformance with 
the CBI Wind Sector Criteria. 
 
  Based on the evidence assessed , the bond is in conformance, in all material 
respects, with the Wind Sector Eligibility Criteria (Version 2.3, April 2023) under 
the Climate Bonds Standard  
4.0.
