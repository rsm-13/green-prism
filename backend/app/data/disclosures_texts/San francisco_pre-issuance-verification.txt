Scope and Objectives 
The San Francisco Public  Utilities Commission (“SFPUC”), has engaged Sustainalytics to review and verify 
that SFPUC’s green bond meets the requirements under the  Water Infrastructure, Nature -Based Solutions, 
criteria of the Climate Bonds Standard.  
The proceeds of the bond will finance green infrastructure projects under the Sewer System Improvement 
Program (SSIP) to manage stormwat er.1 SFPUC has identified eight initial Nominated P rojects under the 
program which include:  
• Mission & Valencia Green Gateway 
• Wiggle Neighborhood Green Corridor 
• Chinatown Green Alley 
• Sunset Boulevard Greenway 
• Holloway Green Street 
• Yosemite Creek Daylighting 
• Visitacion Valley Green Nodes

Issuing Entity’s Responsibility  
SFPUC was responsible for providing information and documents relating to: 
• The details concerning the selection process for the Nominated Projects 
• The details of the Nominated Projects 
• The management systems for internal processes and controls for Nominated Projects, including: 
tracking of proceeds, managing unallocated proceeds and Earmarking funds to Nominated Projects 
• The details of commitments for reporting prior to issuance, including: investment areas, management 
of unallocated proceeds and frequency of periodic Assurance Engagements 
 
Independence and Quality Control  
Sustainalytics, a leading provider of ESG and corporate governance research and ratings to investors, 
conducted the verification of SFPUC’s green bond, issued to finance Nominated Projects, and provided an 
independent opinion informing SFPUC as to the conf ormance of the green bond with the P re-Issuance 
requirement and Water Infrastructure, Nature-Based Solutions criteria of the Climate Bonds Standard. 
Sustainalytics has relied on the information and the facts presented by SFPUC and/or Alliance for Global 
Water Adaptation (AGWA). Sustainalytics is not responsible for any aspect of the Nominated Projects referred 
to in this opinion including estimates, findings, opinions, or conclusions are incorrect. Thus, Sustainalytics 
shall not be held liable if any of the information or data provided by SFPUC management and used as a basis 
for this assessment were not correct or complete. 
Sustainalytics makes all efforts to ensure the highest quality and rigor during its assessment process and 
enlisted its Sustainability Bonds Review Committee to provide oversight over the assessment of the bond. 
 
Verifier’s Responsibility 
The work undertaken as part of this engagement included conversations with relevant SFPUC employees and 
review of relevant documentation to confirm the green bond’s conformance with the Climate Bonds 
Certification Pre-Issuance Requirements, which include:  
• Conformance of SFPUC’s green bond with the Climate Bonds Standard Version 2.1;  
• Conformance with the Technical Criteria on Water Infrastructure, Nature-Based Solutions 
• Conformance with the Internal Processes & Controls requirements 
• Conformance with Reporting Prior to Issuance requirements 
 
Basis of the Opinion 
Sustainalytics conducted the verification in accordance with the Climate Bond Standard Version 2.1 and with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 – Assurance Engagements other than Audits or 
Reviews of Historical Information.  
 
Sustainalytics planned and performed the verification by obtaining evidence and other information and 
explanations that Sustainalytics considers necessary to give reasonable assurance that the SFPUC green 
bonds meets the requirements of the Climate Bond Standard. Upon reviewing evidence and other information, 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that SFPUC will ensure compliance with Climate Bond Standard requirements.  
 
Conclusion 
The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission is aiming to finance infrastructure projects for its Wastewater 
Enterprise which qualify under the Water Infrastructure, Nature-Based Solutions, criteria of the Climate Bonds 
Standard that will contribute to better management of stormwater in the city. Based on the limited assurance 
procedures conducted of the SFPUC’s water infrastructure projects, Sustainalytics believes that, in all material 
respects, SFPUC’s Nominated Projects are in conformance with the Water Infrastructure , Nature -Based 
Solutions criteria of the Climate Bonds Standard Pre-Issuance Requirements.

Schedule 2: Scorecard for Evaluating the Issuer’s Vulnerability 
Assessment & Adaptation Plan 
 
The Mitigation Theme has two major categories: (1) the determination of project - related emissions, and (2) determination of emissions 
reduced/avoided. Eligibility for certification under this theme is determined through existing methodologies deemed acceptable under the 
Water Climate Bonds Standard (e.g. CDM, American Carbon Registry, etc.) 
 
Under the guidance of the methodology selected, the Issuer must propose a clear GHG baseline, which must describe the calcula tions 
and assumptions (inputs) used to arrive at that baseline. Issuers must also estimate net expected GHG impact (mitigation impa ct >0) 
compared to Business as Usual, as well as a credible, independently verifiable, method of tracking impact over the life of the bond. 
Conservative assumptions, values and procedures must be used to ensure that the GHG emission reductions or removals are not over-
estimated. 
 
The issuer is eligible for certification only if either:  
 
a. No net GHG emissions impact is expected, and the issuer discloses the justification for this decision with supporting 
documentation;  
b. A negative net GHG emissions impact is expected, and the issuer has estimated the GHG mitigation impact that will be delivered 
over the operational lifetime of the project or asset. This impact should be defined in terms of the decreased emissions or 
increased sequestration relative to a business as usual baseline." 
 
Evaluation of the issuer’s mitigation assessment 
 
The Alliance for Global Water Adaptation’s (AGWA) has determined that the eight Nominated Projects have no net GHG emissions 
impact. The following scorecard has been completed by AGWA.

climate change on the resource pool? (E.g., using best available science to 
plan for future changes in availability, undertaking periodic monitoring and 
updating of available pool.) 
E 
 
1 N/A 
1.5 Do plans define responses to “exceptional” circumstances, such as an 
extended drought, that influence the allocation regime? (E.g., triggers water 
use restrictions, reduction in allocations according to pre-defined priority uses, 
suspension of the regime plan, etc.) 
E 1 1

1 N/A 
1.7 Are water delivery agreements defined on the basis of  actual in situ 
seasonal/annual availability instead of  volumetric or otherwise inflexible 
mechanisms? 
E 1 1 
1.8 Has a formal environmental flows (e- flows)/sustainable diversion limit or other 
environmental allocation been defined for the relevant sub-basin or basin? (If 
there is a pre-existing plan, then has the environmental flows program been

the resource that can be taken on a sustainable basis. 
2.4 Is there a limit to the proportion (e.g. percentage) of water that can be 
extracted? How might this need to change if water supplies become more 
variable due to climate change? (e.g. will having sufficient amounts to meet 
basic human needs take precedence over others?)
