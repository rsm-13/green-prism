Introduction 
REC Limited  (Issuer) is proposing to issue green finan ce instrument (s) and has appointed KPMG Assurance and 
Consulting Services LLP to provide independent assurance on their Green Finance Framework.  
This report presents our opinion on conformance of their green finance instrument with the pre-issuance requirements 
of the Climate Bonds Standard Version 3.0. 
Assurance Standard 
We conducted our engagement in accordance with requirements of ‘Limited Assurance’ as per International Federation 
of Accountants’ (IFAC) International Standard on Assurance Engagements [ISAE 3000 (Revised), Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information]. 
Scope 
The scope of our assurance included data and information on material aspects of the proposed green finance instrument 
based on the requirements set out in the Pre-Issuance Requirements section of the Climate Bonds Standard Version 
3.0 as listed below: 
• Use of Proceeds
• Process for Evaluation and Selection of Projects & Assets
• Management of Proceeds
• Reporting Prior to Issuance
Approach 
We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence, information and explanations that we considered necessary 
to obtain a meaningful level of assurance in relation to the above scope. The procedures we performed, which are set 
out in more detail below, were based on our professional judgment and included, as appropriate, inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of reporting policies and agreement 
or reconciliation with underlying records. We believe that the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have 
obtained are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion. 
To reach our conclusion we: 
• Conducted interviews with management and key staff of Issuer responsible for the green finance instrument to obtain 
an understanding of the processes, systems and controls in place for management of green finance proceeds;
• Checked the Issuer’s Green Finance Framework that includes processes, systems and controls in place for
management of green finance proceeds; investment areas for green finance proceeds and intended types of
temporary investment instruments for the management of unallocated proceeds; and
• Checked the nominated project and asset which is proposed to be associated with the green finance instrument and
their conformance with eligibility requirements specified in Part C of the Climate Bonds Standard Version 3.0

Exclusions 
Our assurance process was subject to the following limitations as we have not been engaged to: 
• Determine which, if any, recommendations should be implemented
• Provide assurance on information outside the defined reporting boundary and period
• Verify the Issuer’s financial statements & economic performance
• Verify the Issuer’s statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim or future
intention and national or global socio-economic and environmental aspects provided by the Issuer
Independence 
The assurance was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including professionals with suitable skills and experience in 
auditing environmental, social and economic information in line with the requirements of ISAE 3000 standard. Our work 
was performed in compliance with the requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which 
requires, among other requirements, that the members of the assurance team (practitioners) as well as the assurance 
firm (assurance provider) be independent of the assurance client, in relation to the scope of this assurance engagement. 
The Code also includes detailed requirements for practitioners regarding integrity, objectivity, professional competence 
and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. We have systems and processes in place to monitor compliance 
with the Code and to prevent conflicts regarding independence. We apply ISQ M 1 and comply with the applicable 
independence and other ethical requirements of the IESBA code. 
Management’s responsibility 
The Management of the Issuer is responsible for ensuring that the Issuer  and their green finance instrument complies 
with the requirements of the Climate Bonds Standard Version 3.0. This responsibility includes designing, implementing 
and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the management of green finance instrument proceeds. 
The Management of the Issuer  is also responsible for preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying and ensuring 
that Issuer complies with laws and regulations applicable to its activities.  
Our responsibility 
Our responsibility is to report in the form of an independent limited assurance conclusion in relation to the above 
scope based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained. 
This assurance report is made solely to the Issuer in accordance with the terms of our engagement, which include  
agreed arrangements for disclosure. Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Issuer those matters 
we have been engaged to state in this assurance report and for no other purpose. Our assurance report should not be 
regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights against us other than the Issuer or 
the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) in the context of awarding the Certification mark for any purpose or in any other 
context. Any party other than Issuer or CBI who obtains access to our assurance report or a copy thereof and chooses 
to rely on our assurance report (or any part thereof) will do so at its own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
accept or assume no responsibility and deny any liability to any party other than Issuer or CBI for our work, for this 
independent limited assurance report, or for the conclusions we have reached. We expressly disclaim any liability or co-
responsibility for any decision a person or entity would make based on this assurance statement. Our report is released 
to REC Limited on the basis that it shall not be copied, referred to or disclosed, in whole or in part, without our prior

Conclusion 
The following conclusion is based on the work performed, evidence obtained, and the scope of our assurance 
engagement described above. 
Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Gree n Finance Framework to be used for issuance of green 
finance instrument by the Issuer, is not, in all material respects, conforming to the Pre-Issuance requirements of the 
Climate Bonds Standard version 3.0. 
The nominated project and asset that is  proposed to be associated with the Issuer’s green finance instrument offering 
is as follows: 
• 9 Metro Lines in Mumbai with route length of 154.312 km (Developer - Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development
Authority)
The allocated proceeds eligible under the Climate Bonds Standard may change, however, these details will be 
captured in the post-issuance assessment. 
The list of testing procedures carried out are provided in Appendix A along with the list of documents reviewed
