Second-Party Opinion 
Orange SA Sustainability Financing 
Framework 
 
Evaluation Summary 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Orange SA Sustainability Financing Framework 
is credible and impactful and aligns with the Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2021, Green 
Bond Principles 2021, Social Bond Principles 2023, Green Loan Principles 202 3 and 
Social Loan Principles 2023. This assessment is based on the following: 
  The eligible categories for the use of proceeds 1 
are aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Principles , 
Social Bond Principles , Green Loan Principles  and Social Loan 
Principles. Sustainalytics considers that investments in the eligible 
categories will lead to positive environmental or social impacts and 
advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDGs 7, 
8, 9, 10 and 12.  
  Orange has established a 
Sustainable Financing Committee (SFC), which will be responsible for 
evaluating and selecting projects in line with the Framework’s 
eligibility criteria. The SFC convenes at least annually and consists of 
representatives from the Corporate Social Responsibility, Treasury, 
Controlling and Legal  departments supported by other business 
departments or functional teams that have relevant technical and 
sustainability expertise. The SFC will leverage Orange ’s corporate 
governance and inte rnal standards to monitor and mitigate 
environmental and social risks associated with the projects financed 
under the Framework. This is in line with market practice. 
 MANAGEMENT OF PROCEEDS  The SFC will be responsible for the 
management of net proceeds and will track their allocation using a 
Sustainability Register. Orange intends to allocate proceeds within 24 
months after issuance. Pending full allocation, unallocated proceeds 
will be placed temporarily in cash, cash equivalent s, socially 
responsible investment funds or other liquid marketable instruments. 
This is in line with market practice. 
 REPORTING Orange commits to report on the allocation of proceeds 
and the corresponding impact in an allocation and impact  report, 
which will be published on its website on an annual basis until the 
proceeds have been fully allocated. Allocation reporting will include 
the total amount of proceeds allocated per category, share of 
financing and refinancing, amount of unallocated proceeds, share of 
co-financing when relevant and breakdown of eligible projects per 
geography. Sustainalytics views Orange’s allocation and impact 
reporting as aligned with market practice.

Introduction 
Orange SA  (“Orange” or the “Company”) is a multinational telecom service provider  for B2C and B2B 
customers, including other telecommunication operators , offering fixed telephony and mobile 
communications, data transmission, internet and multimedia , and value-added services.  Headquartered in 
Paris, the Company is present in 26 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa with a customer base of 
292 million and 128,000 employees as of 30 September 2024.2  
Orange has developed the Orange SA Sustainability Financing Framework (the “Framework”) under which it 
intends to issue green, social and sustainability (GSS) bonds and obtain GSS  loans (together, the “GSS 
Financings”), and use the proceeds to finance or refinance , in whole or in part, existing and future projects 
that are intended to support the decarbonization efforts of telecom services and digital inclusion in Europe, 
the Middle East and Africa.  
The Framework defines eligibility criteria in three green categories: 
1. Energy Efficiency 
2. Renewable Energy  
3. Circular Economy 
 
The Framework defines eligibility criteria in five social categories: 
 
4. Accelerating Deployment of Optic Fibre Networks in Areas at Risk of Digital Exclusion 
5. Accelerating Deployment of Mobile Networks in Areas at Risk of Digital Exclusion 
6. Digital Skills  
7. Supporting Financial and Social Integration 
8. Supporting Entrepreneurship 
Orange engaged Sustainalytics to review the Framework, dated November 2024, and provide a Second-Party 
Opinion on the Framework’s environmental and social credentials and its alignment with the Sustainability 
Bond Guidelines 2021 (SBG), Green Bond Principles 2021 (GBP), Social Bond Principles 2023 (SBP),3 Green 
Loan Principles 202 3 (GLP) and Social Loan Principles 202 3 (SLP).4 The Framework will be published in a 
separate document.5  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics’ Second-Party Opinion 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent6 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible project categories 
are credible and impactful. 
As part of the Second-Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: 
• The Framework’s alignment with the Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2021, Green Bond Principles 
2021 and Social Bond Principles 2023 as administered by ICMA, and the Green Loan Principles 
2023 and Social Loan Principles 2023, as administered by LMA, APLMA and LSTA; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds; and 
• The alignment of the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds. 
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.17, which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics’ expertise as an ESG research provider.

6 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustainalytics and ensuring analyst 
independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust conflict management 
framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of commercial and research 
(and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last, but not least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial 
outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency.

As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Orange’s 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Orange’s 
representatives have confirmed that they: (1) understand it is the sole responsibility of Orange to ensure that 
the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant 
information; and (3) any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a time ly manner. 
Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non-public information. 
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework. 
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
conditions between Sustainalytics and the Company. 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to be financed with bond and loan proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framewo rk is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner. Upon twenty-four (24) months following the evaluation date set stated 
herein, Orange is encouraged to update the Framework, if necessary, and seek an update to the Second-Party 
Opinion to ensure ongoing alignment of the Framework with market standards and expectations. 
In addition, the Second-Party Opinion opines on the potential allocation of proceeds, but does not guarantee 
the realized allocation of the bond and loan proceeds towards eligible activities. 
No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second -Party Opinion shall be considered as 
being a statement, representation, warrant or argument either in favour or against the truthfulness, reliability 
or completeness of any facts or stateme nts and related surrounding circumstances that Orange has made 
available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second-Party Opinion.   
Sustainalytics’ Opinion 
Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Orange SA Sustainability Financing 
Framework 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Orange SA Sustainability Financing Framework is credible, impactful 
and aligns with the four core components of the  GBP, SBP, GLP and SLP . Sustainalytics highlights the 
following elements of Orange’s Sustainability Financing Framework: 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible categor ies - Energy Efficiency; Renewable Energy; Circular Economy; 
Accelerating Deployment of Optic Fibr e Networks in Areas at Risk of Digital Exclusion; 
Accelerating Deployment of Mobile Networks in Areas at Risk of Digital Exclusion; Digital 
Skills; Supporting Financial and Social Integration; and Supporting Entrepreneurship  - are 
aligned with those recognized by the GBP, SBP, GLP and SLP. 
- Expenditures under the Framework include capex, research and development for some 
green eligible projects, capex and opex for some social eligible projects, equity investments 
for the “Supporting Entrepreneurship” Social Eligible Category and majority equity 
investments in pure play companies.  
- Orange ha s confirmed to Sustainalytics that there will be no double counting  of 
expenditures among green and social categories.

- Orange has defined a look -back period of three years for the refinancing of expenditures, 
which Sustainalytics considers to be in line with market practice. 
- Under the Energy Efficiency category,  Orange may finance or refinance projects related to 
the modernization of its networks and data centres, with the goal of improving their energy 
efficiency. This may include:  
▪ Projects aimed at replacing existing copper networks with fibre to the home 
(FTTH) networks. 
▪ Energy efficiency solutions that  lead to at least 30% cumulative avoided energy 
consumption, including : i) radio access network (RAN)  sharing; ii) software 
licences to optimize data centre cooling  systems intended to be used in data 
centres with a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of less than 1.5; iii) free cooling 
systems for data centres ; iv) energy-efficient equipment , including thermal 
insulation, energy -efficient windows and the replacement of heating and 
ventilation system s; and v) onsite power management systems, such as load 
balancing, energy monitoring and automatic switch-off power systems. 
• Sustainalytics views positively the inclusion of a defined energy 
efficiency threshold for the installation of energy-efficient systems, 
equipment and technologies. 
• Sustainalytics notes that data centres are inherently energy -
intensive, and that Orange intends to finance the installation of 
energy-efficient systems, hardware and technologies in data 
centres to reduce overall GHG emissions and improve energy 
performance.  
▪ Construction of new data centres with a PUE of less than 1.3 in Europe and up to 
1.5 in the Middle East and Africa. 
▪ Research and development of digital products and services intended to reduce the 
energy consumption and GHG emissions of Orange’s clients, including the Internet 
of Things  (IoT), Smart Operations ,8 Smart Eco -Energy,9 big data and artificial 
intelligence (AI) applications and smart metering. 
• By enabling high -speed network connectivity, Orange’s solutions 
have the potential to support end users to save energy across 
industrial sectors. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that investments 
in this category are expected to provide net-positive environmental 
impacts while noting variations in the energy demands on the 
network and the range of end-user technologies that it supports.  
• Sustainalytics notes that the Framework excludes specific 
activities that are associated with fossil fuels. Additionally, 
Sustainalytics understands that the Company cannot exercise any 
control over the use and application of the IoT - and AI -enabling 
technologies once sold.  
• Sustainalytics acknowledges that t he expansion of IoT and AI 
networks and increasing data flow resulting from IoT and AI 
solutions may result in additional energy demands on 
telecommunications networks. Nevertheless, Sustainalytics 
believes that the enabled savings outweigh the potential adverse 
effects of additional network energy demand.  
• Sustainalytics notes that Orange will limit financ ing under the 
Framework to projects where the Company can report on the 
expected quantitative environmental impact  in line with the 
indicators included under the Framework. 
▪ Orange has confirmed to Sustainalytics that solutions under this category exclude 
the application to transmissions lines connected or dedicated to fossil fuel power.    
▪ Sustainalytics considers the investment s under this category to be in line with 
market practice. 
- Under the Renewable Energy category,  Orange may finance or refinance the installation, 
maintenance and repair of onsite renewable energy projects related to solar PV and onshore 
and offshore wind. Orange has confirmed to Sustainalytics that the fossil fuel back -up of

the offshore wind  facilities is limited to power monitoring, operating and maintenance 
equipment, as well as resilience or protection measures and restart capabilities.  
Sustainalytics considers the investment s under this category to be in line with market 
practice. 
- Under the Circular Economy category, Orange may finance or refinance the following 
activities: 
▪ Repairing, refurbishing, remanufacturing and recycling of fixed customer premises 
equipment, such  as liveboxes, airboxes, routers, set -up boxes  or set-top boxes . 
Orange has confirmed to Sustainalytics that the eligible projects related to e-waste 
recycling will have a robust waste management plan to ensure mitigation of any 
risks associated with such activities. For additional detail, see Section 2. 
▪ Acquisition of refurbished IT and network equipment, including those  for data 
centres with a PUE of less than 1.5. Orange has confirmed that there will be no 
double counting of financing among expenditures related to data centres under 
the Energy Efficiency and Circular Economy categories under the Framework.  
▪ Investments related to the provision of products through service models for 
customer equipment with an aim to extend the lifespan of the equipment,10 such 
as mobile phones through the Orange Circular Mobility Offer.11,12   
▪ Orange has communicated to Sustainalytics that the proceeds will be used to 
finance the: i) acquisition of eligible assets , such as mobile phones , for leasing; 
and ii) post-asset acquisition expenditures, including the maintenance of assets.  
Sustainalytics notes that Orange ’s eligibility criteria  are consistent  with the EU 
Taxonomy’s Annex 2  Substantial Contribution  Criteria for “Product-as-a-service 
and other circular use - and result -oriented service models .13 Sustainalytics 
considers such programmes to have positive  environmental impact as Orange 
recollects and refurbishes the eligible assets before redistribution.  
▪ Sustainalytics also notes that the expenditures financed under the Framework 
may include the acquisition of assets to be leased, and further notes that the 
primary impact from leasing contributing to a circular economy would be derived 
from the operational leasing, including the take-back and maintenance of assets 
and products, which leads to their extended use.  
▪ Sustainalytics recognizes that financing operational leasing contributes to a 
circular economy by allowing one asset to be utilized by several users, and notes 
that it has the potential to contribute to limiting GHG emissions resulting from the 
manufacturing of new products.  
▪ Sustainalytics considers the investments under this category to be in line with 
market practice. 
- Under the Accelerating Deployment of Optic Fibre Networks in Areas at Risk of Digital 
Exclusion category, Orange may finance or refinance projects that improve access to optic 
fibre networks to unconnected or underserved populations lacking network connectivity in 
rural areas in Europe, the Middle East and Africa: 
▪ Upgrading of copper ADSL to optic fibre in rural  areas in France  limited to  the 
French government’s “Public Initiative Networks” (PIN)14,15 or “French Local Public 
Expression of Interest” (AMEL) national high-speed broadband programmes,16 as 
part of the French government’s “Plan France Très Haut Débit”.17 
 
10 Such programmes will be governed by the following terms and conditions: i) Orange remains the owner of the equipment; ii) Ora nge is obliged to take 
back the equipment at the end of the programme; iii) the customer is obliged to return the equipment at the end of the agreement; and iv) the customer 
pays for the access to and use of the equipment or the result of access to and use of the equipment. 
11 Orange has communicated to Sustainalytics that the programmes also follow International Telecommunication Union’s ITU-T L.1480 (12/2022) 
recommendations.

• Plan France Très Haut Débit identifies the PIN and AMEL areas by 
using population density data ( the PIN and AMEL areas being 
considered as “low density”) as a proxy for connectivity. 18 Orange 
has communicated to Sustainalytics that the reliability and speed 
of a copper network depends on the distance between the 
connection node and the user. As a result, the PIN and AMEL areas 
are expected to have an average speed below the national average 
of between 8 and 10 Mbps.19 
• Sustainalytics considers investment in areas that have an average 
network speed of below 10 Mbps to be socially impactful in line 
with the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) definition 
of “meaningful connectivity”. Sustainalytics further notes t hat 
financing under the Framework may indirectly benefit  areas that 
have an average network speed of above 10 Mbps, which 
Sustainalytics views as having limited social impact. 
• Nevertheless, Sustainalytics considers that the positive social 
impact of these expenditures is assured to a certain extent given 
their alignment with the national infrastructure goals and their 
objective to enhance connectivity in areas with inadequate ac cess 
to such infrastructure. Sustainalytics encourages Orange to 
prioritize the financing of locations with average network speeds of 
less than 10 Mbps, where feasible.20 
▪ Underserved rural areas in  Poland, which  are identified by Poland’s Krajowego 
Planu Odbudowy (KPO)21 and Funduszy Europejskich na Rozwój Cyfrowy (FERC) 
programmes.22 
• Orange has communicated to Sustainalytics that the Company will 
target the “ white spots ” under the KPO and FERC program mes. 
Sustainalytics notes that white spots are generally defined as areas 
with no access to mobile networks and fixed broadband , while 
definitions might vary depending on the local definitions. 
Sustainalytics views this to be credible targeting and views the 
expenditure to be socially impactful. 
▪ Underserved rural areas outside France and Poland, including the population living 
in white spots  defined by local authorities that require FTTH network to be 
developed or upgraded to meet or exceed the minimum speed expectation of the 
government’s broadband plan.  
• Sustainalytics views this targeting positively and further 
encourages Orange to invest in areas with network speeds below 
10 Mbps, in line with the International Telecommunication Union’s 
(ITU) definition of “meaningful connectivity”.23 
▪ Underserved rural areas outside France and Poland  with broadband network  
speed below 10 Mbps. Sustainalytics views this targeting to be credible and views 
the expenditure to be socially impactful. 
- Under the Accelerating Deployment of Mobile Networks in Areas at Risk of Digital Exclusion 
category, Orange may finance projects that improve access to mobile networks for 
underserved populations in rural areas located in Europe, the Middle East and Africa . The 
Framework defines the target population as follows:   
▪ Underserved populations with mobile broadband speed below 3G+.

▪ Rural areas in France identified by the French government’s “ la couverture des 
zones peu denses ” (Coverage of Sparsely Populated Areas ) national high -speed 
mobile broadband programme.24 
▪ Rural areas outside France are defined as populations living in white spots  or 
equivalent, as defined by local authorities, and rural areas requiring mobile 
networks to be developed or upgraded to meet or exceed the minimum speed 
expectation of the government’s broadband plan.  
▪ Sustainalytics views this targeting positively  and further encourages Orange to 
invest in areas lacking access to mobile networks of 3G or above , in line with the 
International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) definition of “meaningful 
connectivity”.25 
- Under the Digital skills category, Orange may finance or refinance digital support and 
training programmes to reduce the digital divide of digitally excluded populations.  
▪ Orange has confirmed that the program mes financed under this category are 
provided free of charge. 
▪ Orange has communicated to Sustainalytics that the programmes financed will 
be: i) available in Europe, the Middle East and Africa; ii) conducted in the form of 
in-person or online workshops or training courses; and iii) provided through Orange 
Group’s subsidiaries, Orange Foundation s and partnerships with non -
governmental organizations (NGOs) . 
▪ The Framework defines the target population for this activity as digitally excluded 
populations for reasons of purchasing power, technological skills or their personal 
situations, particularly in terms of education or training . Orange has 
communicated to Sustainalytics that  the Group , its subsidiaries  and Orange 
Foundations select the target populations. The main target groups include children 
under 15, young people (aged 15-24), digitally excluded women, the elderly and 
rural communities . Orange has confirmed that it will review and approve each 
training program me and associated targeted populations . In addition, Orange 
intends to evaluate the social impact of the programmes being financed under this 
category.  
▪ Sustainalytics considers the intended programmes to be socially impactful in the 
regional context and encourages the Company to transparently report on the 
social impact of the projects, especially for the identified target groups. 
- Under the Supporting Financial and Social Integration  category, Orange may finance the 
development of digital banking services. 
▪ The Framework defines the target population  for this activity as individuals living 
in emerging markets and developing economies 26 within the Middle East and 
Africa.  
▪ Orange has communicated to Sustainalytics that financing under this category will 
be limited to capex related to the development of the Orange Money platform , 
which is an “electronic wallet” that provides mobile financial services , such as 
money transfers, bill payments and purchasing phone credits, which are primarily 
available in 18 African and Middle Eastern countries.27  
▪ Orange has confirmed to Sustainalytics that the Company is not involved in the 
provision of financial services.  
▪ Sustainalytics considers these investments to be socially impactful.   
- Under the Supporting entrepreneurship category, Orange may finance or refinance impact 
funds for start -ups aimed at supporting employment generation, including the Orange

Ventures Impact Fund in the Middle East and Africa.28 Orange intends to provide financial 
assistance to technology start-ups under the following initiatives: 
▪ Orange has communicated to Sustainalytics that financing under the fund would 
be limited to MSMEs within the Middle East and Africa. 
▪ Middle East & Africa Seed, which supports MSMEs specifically located in 18 
countries within the Middle East and Africa.29  
▪ Middle East & Africa Growth, which supports MSMEs within the Middle East and 
Africa. Orange has confirmed to Sustainalytics that financing will not be extended 
to MSMEs in developing, high-income countries in the Middle East.30 
▪ Sustainalytics notes that credit conditions in developing economies are more 
restrictive and, therefore, views the targeting of this expenditure as socially 
impactful. 
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- Orange has established a Sustainable Financing Committee (the “SFC”) which will be 
responsible for evaluating and selecting projects in line with the Framework’s eligibility 
criteria. The SFC convenes at least annually and consists of representatives from the 
Corporate Social Responsibility, Treasury, Controlling and Legal departments supported by 
other business departments or functional teams that have relevant technical and 
sustainability expertise.   
- The SFC will leverage Orange’s corporate governance and internal standards to monitor and 
mitigate environmental and social risks associated with the projects financed through the 
Framework. The SFC is also responsible for enforcing the policy as well as applicable laws 
and regulations and applying them to all allocation decisions made under the Framework. 
Sustainalytics considers these environmental and social risk management systems to be 
adequate and aligned with the requirements of GBP, GLP, SBP, SLP and SBG. For additional 
detail, see Section 2.  
• Management of Proceeds: 
- The SFC  will be responsible for the management of net proceeds and will track their 
allocation using a Sustainability Register.  
- The Company intends to allocate proceeds within 24 months after each issuance. Pending 
full allocation, unallocated proceeds will be placed temporarily in cash, cash equivalent, 
socially responsible investment funds or other liquid marketable instrument s. Orange has 
confirmed the exclusion of financing carbon -intensive assets or activities under the 
temporary use of proceeds. 
- Orange has communicated to Sustainalytics that instruments issued under the Framework 
may include multi-tranche loan facilities. The Company intends to label only those tranches 
of such facilities whose proceeds will be allocated according to the eligibility criteria in the 
Framework.  
- Based on the use of an internal tracking system and the disclosure of the temporary use of 
proceeds, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. 
• Reporting: 
- The Company commits to report on the allocation of proceeds and the corresponding 
impact in an allocation and impact report, which will be published on its investor relations 
website on an annual basis until the proceeds have been fully allocated. Allocation reporting 
will include the total amount of proceeds allocated per category, share of financing and 
refinancing, amount of unallocated proceeds, share of co -financing when r elevant and

- Based on the commitment to allocation and impact reporting, Sustainalytics considers this 
process to be in line with market practice. 
Alignment with Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2021 
Sustainalytics has determined that the Orange SA Sustainability Financing Framework  aligns with the four 
core components of the GBP, SBP, GLP and SLP.  
Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of Orange 
Contribution to Orange’s sustainability strategy 
Orange’s sustainability commitments focus on four key environmental and social areas: i) reducing carbon 
emissions in its value chain; ii) promoting a circular economy in its production processes and businesses; iii) 
supporting its B2B operations to be more sustainable; and iv) making technology accessible to all and improve 
digital inclusion.31 
Orange has set a target to achieve net zero emissions by 2040. At the end of 2023, Orange had reduced its 
scope 1 and 2 emissions by 37.4%, compared to the 2015 baseline, surpassing its original target of reducing 
such emissions by 30% by 2025 ahead of schedule.32 Orange has also committed to near-term targets, such 
as reducing its scope 3 emissions by 14% by 2025, compared to the 2018 baseline, and absolute scope 1, 2 
and 3 GHG emissions by 45% by 2030 for the digital sector , compared to the 202 0 baseline.33 As of 2023, 
46.6% of the Company’s consumed electricity is derived from renewable sources. The Company committed 
to reduce scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel - and energy-related activities covering purchased and resold 
electricity by 73.8% per MWh within the same timeframe.34 To achieve net zero across its value chain by 2040, 
Orange has committed to : i) reducing CO2e emissions by 90%  from a 2020 base year through decreasing 
electricity consumption that is directly or indirectly linked to fossil fuels  that the Company, its suppliers or 
customers consume; and ii) reducing absolute scope 1,  2 and 3 GHG emissions  by 90% by 2040, compared 
to the 2020 baseline.35,36  
To promote a circular economy in its production processes and businesses, Orange has implemented several 
initiatives that focus on sustainability and resource efficiency  in its value chain in order to  reduce its direct 
and indirect emissions and support the Company’s decarbonization targets. For example, Orange introduced 
the “Re” initiative in 2020, which promotes the collection of used devices that encourages customers to return 
their old phones and equipment while creating job opportunities.37,38 In 2023, Orange achieved a mobile phone 
collection rate of 25.4% in Europe, and 480,000 mobiles were collected in Africa for recycling. In addition, the 
Company has implemented an eco-design approach, which involves designing products and services that use 
recyclable materials  and minimizing the use of hazardous substances in its devices. 39 In 2023, 9.5% of 
Orange’s products were based on the eco-design approach.40  
To make technology accessible to all and improve digital inclusion, Orange has invested in projects to expand 
high-speed broadband and enhance its mobile network coverage, including the rollout of fibre, increasing its 
4G/5G coverage and introducing consumer satellite services in France to improve digital cohesion in 
underserved regions.41 In addition, Orange has implemented several initiatives and programmes in the Middle 
East, Africa and Europe, including free digital training programmes deployed by the Orange Foundation to help 
people acquire basic digital skills and gain confidence in using digital tools .42 The program mes were 
conducted in 25 countries and have reached 1.8 million beneficiaries between 2021 and 2023.43 The Company 
has also set a target of reaching 6 million cumulative beneficiaries by 2030.44

Second-Party Opinion  
Orange SA Sustainability Financing Framework  
  
 
  
 
10 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Orange SA Sustainability Financing Framework is aligned with the 
Company’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will further the Company’s action on its key 
environmental and social priorities. 
Approach to managing environmental and social risks associated with the projects  
Sustainalytics recognizes that the proceeds from the instruments issued under the Framework will be directed 
towards eligible projects that are expected to have positive environmental and social impact. However, 
Sustainalytics is aware that such eligible projects could also lead t o negative environmental and social 
outcomes. Some key environmental and social risks possibly associated with the eligible projects may include 
issues related to: i) data privacy and security; ii) effluents and waste during constr uction; iii) risks related to 
the processing of electronic waste ; iv) supply chain risks ; v) occupational health and safety (OHS) ; vi) 
community relations and stakeholder engagement; and vii) business ethics.  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Orange is able to manage and/or mitigate potential risks through the 
implementation of the following:  
 
• To manage data privacy and security risks , Orange processes personal data in compliance with 
international regulatory requirements, such as  the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 45 in 
Europe and other applicable laws in the Middle East and Africa. 46 The Company has also 
implemented the Global Security Management System ( “GSMS”) framework to manage security 
risks by defining responsibilities, resources and necessary controls.47 As part of the GSMS , the 
Company has  adopted a Group Security Policy (“GSP”), which sets out  the main guidelines and 
requirements to implement security measure s to protect customer data, employee information, 
business process es and infrastructure s.48 Additionally, the Company has established a Group 
Security Department, which is responsible for identifying cybersecurity risks and regularly assessing 
and monitoring the proper implementation of the GSP.49  
• Sustainalytics notes that  the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic ha ve 
faced controversies related to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.  Orange’s Vigilance 
Plan notes that government orders in these countries to suspend or alter the Company’s connectivity 
services do not comply with international legal frameworks, including Articles 12 and 19 of the United 
Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights 50 and Articles 17 and 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). 51,52 Therefore, for requests from national authorities 
to make such changes, including reducing internet speeds, limiting access to certain social networks, 
interrupting telecommunication services, suspend ing or intercept ing communications, or shar ing 
personal data with third parties, the Company  will respond in accordance with the laws and 
regulations of each country and the licen ces authorizing telecommunication operations. 53 In 
addition, Orange follows the Global Network Initiative’s (GNI) guidelines on handling such requests 
for interruptions.54 During periods of expected high risk, such as elections or international events, 
Orange establishes dedicated units coordinated by its security department to monitor compliance 
with the GNI principles.55 Furthermore, Orange has conducted an annual risk assessment since 2012 
in all the countries where it operates and has established management plans for different scenarios 
resulting from government requests.56 
• For risks related to effluents and waste generated in construction, Orange has established a supplier 
code of conduct that requires suppliers to comply with environmental practices, including monitoring

and managing waste, treating air, water and soil  pollutants before they are discharged , as well as  
reducing GHG emissions and minimizing energy use .57 The Company also has in place a Waste 
Prevention and Management policy  that focuses on extending equipment  life through the 
optimization of their end -of-life treatment. 58 Furthermore, t he Company has established an 
Environmental Management System (“EMS”) that aligns with applicable regulations and standards 
to mitigate the environmental impact of construction activities.  For example, the Company 
encourages its suppliers to implement an EMS based on international standards , such as ISO 
1400159 or an equivalent standard . As of 2023, 58.1% of the Company’s global operations are ISO 
14001:2015 certified. In addition,  Orange Marine and Orange’s subsidiaries in Egypt, Mali, Poland, 
Romania, Slovenia and Spain are fully ISO 14001:2015 certified.60  
• To address risks related to the processing of electronic waste, Orange has in place  a Waste of 
Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) policy to manage hazardous waste from collection to 
treatment.61 Under this policy, the Company is committed to: i) establishing an internal strategy for 
collecting, treating and trac king electronic and battery waste ; ii) organizing processing channels 
through partnerships to properly dismantle e-waste; and iii) selecting service providers for e-waste 
treatment based on service performance evaluations.62 Sustainalytics notes that for its operations 
in the EU, Orange complies with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, 63 which 
encourages the reuse, recycling and recovery of electrical and electronic waste, and ensures the safe 
disposal and treatment of hazardous substances. Orange also complies with the EU Battery 
regulation,64 which establishes efficient management of batteries throughout their life cycle, 
including production, use, recycling and disposal. Additionally, the Company observes the European 
Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS2),65 which limits the use of specific hazardous substances in electrical 
and electronic equipment from suppliers, and the European regulation 1907/2006 (REACH),66 on the 
registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals. 67 Sustainalytics notes that the 
Middle East and Africa regions do not implement such strong legal frameworks to regulate e-waste 
management. However, Sustainalytics notes that Orange’s WEEE policy applies to the above regions 
and is supported by specific guidelines to help the aforementioned countries manage electronic 
waste.68 Specifically, the guidelines require the Group’s subsidiaries to: i) separate, collect and trace 
waste; ii) store it in secure locations; iii) select a processing sub-contractor that is required to provide 
documentation for tracking the waste ; and iv) report on the recycling or destruction of the waste. 
Additionally, Orange is dedicated to offering electronic waste recovery and treatment solutions to 
facilities located in the Middle East and Africa by 2024, as well as establishing long-term appropriate 
waste treatment infrastructure in its subsidiaries in these regions.69,70 Orange informed 
Sustainalytics that the Group began identifying service providers in 2024 for the collection, transport, 
processing and traceability of waste in Africa , and that  only a few were able to meet Orange's 
requirements. Under the French law no. 2017-399, all of Orange’s subsidiaries and divisions are 
required to locally implement the Group’s Vigilance Plan, which includes a risk assessment for the 
ineffective recovery of used equipment and devices.71 
• To manage supply chain risks, Orange requires its suppliers to adhere to its supplier code of conduct 
to enforce responsible and ethical procurement practices.72 The code mandates that all suppliers: i) 
implement internationally recognized standards on human rights and child labour, such as the United

Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights 73 and the International Labor Organization  
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work ;74 ii) implement necessary measures to 
prevent accidents and occupational illnesses ; iii) refrain from all forms of corruption ; and iv) 
minimize the environmental impact of their activities. 75 The code also includes a reporting 
mechanism to disclose any violations or risks related to corruption, fraud, environmental violations 
or human rights abuses. 76 Additionally, Orange conducts regular corporate social responsibility 
assessments of suppliers deemed to have high risks  and prepare corrective action plans on a case 
by case basis.77  
• Regarding occupational health and safety (OHS) management, Orange has adopted a Health, Safety 
and Quality of Life Group policy, which establishes a framework to regulate the Company’s health 
and safety measures in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organizatio n and the 
conventions of the International Labor Organization .78,79 The policy is applicable to Orange’s 
stakeholders, partners and subcontractors and mandates the Company’s entities to have an ISO 
4500180 compliant OHS management system that includes: i) implementing risk management 
processes that prioritize primary prevention; ii) monitoring compliance towards health and safety 
instructions; iii) conducting regular assessments of health and safety objectives and indicators; and 
iv) conducting regular information and training initiatives.81   
• Sustainalytics notes that financing under the Framework could be allocated to investments in the 
Middle East, which faces allegations over human and labour rights issues, especially related to 
migrant workers. Orange has in place a Human Rights Group policy which applies to all the  
Company’s stakeholders, namely employees, their representatives, suppliers, business partners, B2C 
and B2B customers, civil society and its representatives, investors, authorities, and international and 
industry organizations. 82 The policy follows internationally recognized human rights frameworks, 
including the UN Declaration on Human Rights, ILO’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work, United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,83 OECD Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises84 and the UN Global Compact.85 The Company is also a signatory to the 
British and Australian Modern Slavery Acts. 86 In addition , Orange requires its suppliers and 
subcontractors to apply these standards in their own purchasing processes using the CSR clause in 
contracts and the Supplier Code of Conduct. The Company  also assesses the compliance of its 
international equipment suppliers , including their subcontractors,  with human rights standards  
through audits conducted by an association of telecommunication operators, namely, Joint Alliance 
for CSR.87 
• To address risks related to community relations and stakeholder engagement, Orange has developed 
a stakeholder dialogue methodology, which involves interactions and consultations with internal and 
external stakeholders, aimed at identifying improvement areas of Orange’s business activities.88 The 
Company employs a semi-quantitative rating system to prioritize stakeholders’ opi nions and 
expectations, allowing for a comparison of the internal perspective with an external one.89 
• With respect to business ethics, the Group Code of Ethics and Orange Group Anti-Corruption policy 
follow internationally-recognized business ethics principles, such as the United Nations Global 
Compact. It covers the Company’s processes to manage  unethical business behaviour, including

fraud, corruption, influence peddling and tax avoidance.90,91,92 Orange has also implemented local 
business ethics policy frameworks and appointed an ethics committee in each country the Company 
operates.93 In addition, all of Orange’s employees receive training on compliance and business ethics 
on a regular basis.94 The Company also has a whistleblower tool, called Hello Ethics,  which allows 
employees and third parties to anonymously report suspected misconduct.95  
• Sustainalytics notes that Orange intends to finance its Orange Money platform, which offers mobile 
financial services, in several countries across the Middle East and Africa, including the Democratic 
Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic – both of which present elevated risks related to 
poor business practices, including corruption, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. To 
address these risks, Orange has in place a comprehensive compliance policy that aligns with both 
national and international regulatory requirements, as well as its own  internal guidelines. This 
includes regional compliance policies tailored to  each country in which  Orange operates. These 
policies outline governance processes and measures  designed to prevent, mitigate, manage  and 
report unethical business behaviour.96 
Based on these policies, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Orange has 
implemented adequate measures and is well-positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social 
risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Sustainalytics further notes that despite the adequate 
procedures and assessments, limitations and restrictions on network access remain a prevalent issue in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic where authorities can limit freedom of 
expression. Therefore, Sustainalytics considers this to be an ongoing risk. 
Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
All eight use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by GBP, SBP, GLP or SLP. Sustainalytics 
has focused on one below where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. 
Impact of network transformation to increase energy efficiency globally 
As of 2022, the ICT sector accounted for at least 1.7% of global GHG emissions, with telecom operators 
responsible for 0.4% of global GHG emissions from energy and 1% of global electricity consumption.97 Current 
mobile networks use only 15% of the energy that they demand towards data transfer, but waste the remaining 
85% because of heat loss, intermittency and inefficient infrastructure.98 Demand for data centres and network 
services is expected to continue to grow and, if left unchecked, could lead the industry’s share of global 
emissions to reach up to 14% by 2040.99  
To align with the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Agreement, the sector needs to reduce its GHG emissions by 
45% between 2020 and 2030. 100 According to the Science based Targets initiative (SBTi), d ecarbonization 
actions in the ICT sector to align with a 1.5°C trajectory by 2030 should mainly focus on: i) continued 
implementation of energy efficiency plans; ii) a shift to renewable or low -carbon electricity supply; and iii) 
encouragement of carbon consciousness among end users. 101 A report by the ITU and World Benchmarking 
Alliance emphasize s that improving energy efficiency will be essential for the telecom sector’s 
decarbonization pathway by transitioning from legacy to newer technologies. 102 Notably, increasing the use 
of smart digital solutions have the potential to reduce global CO2 emissions by up to 15%,103 with fibre touted

Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Orange’s investments in network technologies are expected to improve 
energy efficiency and contribute to the decarbonization efforts of the telecom sector.

Conclusion  
Orange SA has developed the Orange SA Sustainability Financing Framework, under which it may issue  and 
obtain GSS Financings and use the proceeds to finance projects in the following categories: Energy Efficiency; 
Renewable Energy; Circular Economy; Accelerating Deployment of Optic Fibre Networks in Areas at Risk of 
Digital Exclusion; Accelerating Deployment of Mobile Networks in Areas at Risk of Digital Exclusion; Digital 
Skills; Supporting Financial and Social Integration; and Supporting Entrepreneurship. Sustainalytics considers 
that the eligible projects are expected to provide positive environmental and social impacts and support the 
decarbonization efforts of the telecom services and digital inclusion in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
The Orange SA  Sustainability Financing Framework outlines a process for the tracking, allocation and 
management of proceeds and makes commitments for reporting on allocation and impact. Sustainalytics 
considers that the Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of Orange and that the use of 
proceeds will contribute to advance  the UN Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, 9, 1 0 and 12. Additionally, 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Company has adequate measures to identify, manage a nd mitigate 
environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects. 
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Orange is well positioned to issue sustainability bonds  
and obtain sustainability  loans and that the Orange SA  Sustainability Financing Framework is robust, 
transparent and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2021, Social Bond 
Principles 2023, Green Loan Principles 2023 and Social Loan Principles 2023.
