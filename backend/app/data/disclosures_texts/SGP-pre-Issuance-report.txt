Scope and Objectives 
Société du Grand Paris (“SGP”) has engaged Sustainalytics to review and verify that SGP’s green bond meets 
the requirements under the Low Carbon Transport criteria of the Climate Bonds Standard.  
Société du Grand Paris is a French state -owned co mpany providing transportation and infrastructure 
construction services in the Paris Metropolitan Area. SGP is t asked with designing and developing 
infrastructure projects for the public transport network of the Paris Metropolitan Area, with the aim to promote 
a sustainable, inclusive and job creating environment. Société du Grand Paris confirmed its adherence to the 
climate strategy of the French government, namely the Climate Plan,1 which outlines France’s goal to become 
carbon neutral by 2050. A major area of focus in the Climate Plan is the goal of “making clean transport 
accessible to all, and developing innovation.”  
In line with the French Government’s sustainability goals, Société du Grand Paris received the mission to 
design and implement the Grand Paris Express2, a cluster of new rapid transit lines in the Ile-de-France region 
and the Paris Metropolitan Area , with the purpose to ensure better commuter service, stimulate regional 
development and innovation. 
Société du Grand Paris is intending to issue green bonds in order  to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, 
existing and future projects that improve mobility services and related-infrastructure, namely the:  
• (i) Construction of new lines and line extensions: almost 200 km of new automatic metro lines 
supplementing the 400 km of existing lines in the Ile-de-France region  
• (ii) Construction and development of new stations and technical centres: 68 stations and 7 
technical centres planned  
 
Société du Grand Paris confirmed to S ustainalytics that all its Eligible Assets (metros, metro lines and the 
supporting infrastructure such as the stations and technical centres) are fully electrified and support electric 
assets uniquely.  
 
In line with the stated goal of the Grand Paris Express to support the economic and urban transformation of 
the Paris Metropolitan Area, Société du Grand Paris will allocate the green bond proceeds with the aim to 
support the urban densification of the Capital region around the cluster of electrified metro lines and thus help 
contribute to lower the carbon footprint of the region.

Sustainalytics planned and performed the verification by obtaining evidence and other information and 
explanations that Sustainalytics considers necessary to give reasonable assurance that SGP’s green bond 
meets the requirements of the Climate Bond Standard.  Upon revie wing evidence and other information, 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Société du Grand Paris will ensure compliance with Climate Bond Standard 
requirements. 
 
Conclusion 
    
SGP’s green bond will finance and refinance Eligible Assets related to (i) the construction of new electric metro 
lines and line extensions, and (ii) the construction and development of new stations and technical centres for 
electric metros. 
Based on the limited assurance procedures conducted, nothing has come to Sustainalytics’ att ention that 
causes us to believe that, in all material aspects, SGP’s inaugural bond is not in conformance with the Low 
Carbon Transport criteria of the Climate Bond Standard Pre-Issuance Requirements.
