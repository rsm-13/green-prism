ABN AMRO commissioned ISS-oekom to compile a Verifi cation Report for Post-Issuance Certification 
by the Climate Bond Initiative (CBI) of its Green B ond issued in 2018. The Climate Bond Certification 
process includes verifying whether the provisions o f the Climate Bond Standard issued by the CBI are 
met and obtaining evidence to support the verificat ion. 
 
 
Relevant CBI Standards for this Post-Issuance Clima te Bond Certification:  
•  Climate Bond Standard (Climate Bond Standard Versio n 2.1; status 01/2017)    
•  Low Carbon Buildings – Residential Property  
•  Marine Renewable Energy Sector Eligibility Criteria  (status 10/2017)   
 
ABM AMRO’s responsibility was to provide informatio n and documentation on:  
•  Selection of nominated projects & assets  
•  Internal processes & controls  
•  (Proposed) reporting

ISS-oekom reviewed the information and documentatio n provided and developed by ABM AMRO to 
assess the Green Bond’s alignment with the CBI requ irements: 
•  Conformance with the selection of nominated project s & assets requirements  
•  Conformance with the internal processes & controls requirements  
•  Conformance with the reporting requirements    
ISS-oekom’s approach to assess whether the issuer m eets the criteria of the CBI standard was as 
follows. The issuer provided an overview over the a ssets to be included in the Green Bond asset pool 
and the relevant processes regarding the proceeds ( e.g. use of proceeds, management of proceeds) to 
ISS-oekom. Further, the issuer needed to fill in a questionnaire that covers all criteria of the Clima te 
Bonds Standard 2.1. Additionally, the issuer had to provide background documents that elaborate further 
on the information mentioned in the questionnaire. With the help of this questionnaire and the 
background documents, ISS-oekom carried out a desk- based assessment of the CBI criteria. In case 
any answers were unclear, ISS-oekom contacted the i ssuer for more details and clarification. 
 
 
This Verification Report for Post-Issuance Climate Bond Certification including all documentation 
provided alongside is intended for the use of ABN A MRO and the Climate Bond Standard Board. The 
present document may be published by ABN AMRO, CBI and ISS-oekom. CBI and ISS-oekom agree to 
publish the report with the consent of ABN AMRO.

Requirement  Factual Findings 
Analysis 
against 
Requirements  
4.1 Decision-making process to 
determine the continuing 
eligibility of nominated 
projects and assets 
The bond aims to contribute to the energy 
transition and development of the circular 
economy. ABN AMRO has adopted formal 
targets with regard to the financing of 
sustainable real estate, renewable energy 
and the circular economy. Green bonds 
attract dedicated funding for these strategic 
focus areas. 
On at least a quarterly basis, Global 
Treasury Support will review the Eligible 
Assets in line with the Eligibility Criteria 
described in the Green Bond Framework.  
For the categories Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy, these Eligibility Criteria 
comply with the CBI sector criteria for: 
marine renewable energy and low carbon 
buildings. In case loans or investments are 
no longer eligible or have been repaid early, 
ABN AMRO will make an effort to replace 
these assets with other Eligible Assets. 
✓ 
4.2 Conformance with the 
Bond’s documented 
objectives and requirements 
of Part B of the CBI 
Standard 
All the full amount of the net proceeds is 
distributed to Eligible Assets (in categories 
which comply with the CBI sector criteria).   
✓ 
4.3 No double nomination of 
projects and assets 
The Management of Treasury department 
will approve allocations of bond proceeds to 
Eligible Assets on at least a quarterly basis. 
ABN AMRO has also engaged an external 
consultant to increase transparency.

Analysis 
against 
Requirements  
5.1 Allocation of net proceeds 
to nominated projects and 
assets.  
The full amount of the net proceeds is 
distributed to Offshore Wind farms and 
Green Buildings (private mortgages).  
This is published in ABN AMRO’s quarterly 
communication regarding the allocation of 
proceeds, stating that 100% of the use of 
proceeds is allocated towards eligible 
assets. 
✓ 
5.2  Allocation of funds within 24 
months of issuance of the 
bond 
 
cf. 5.1  
✓ 
5.3 Share of financing and 
refinancing. 
98% of the net proceeds of the Green Bond 
were used to refinance existing assets and 
2% were used to finance new assets.  
✓ 
5.4 Tracking of proceeds On at least a quarterly ba sis the business 
lines, as owners of the assets, will make a 
selection based on the Eligibility Criteria as 
described in paragraph 2.1 of the ABN 
AMRO Green Bond Framework. After 
selection each business line will provide a 
pre-defined report to Global Treasury 
Support. Based on this, Treasury officers 
will review whether existing and new assets 
qualify as Eligible Assets. Management of 
Treasury will review and approve allocations 
of bond proceeds to Eligible Assets on at 
least a quarterly basis. 
The net proceeds of the outstanding bonds 
will be moved to a Green Bond portfolio. For 
as long as the Green Bonds are 
outstanding, ABN AMRO aims to allocate an 
amount equivalent to the net proceeds of 
the bonds towards Eligible Assets.  
✓ 
5.5 Net proceeds of the loan 
and investment to 
nominated assets 
At the time of issuance, ABN AMRO seeks 
to ensure that the bond proceeds can be 
directed in full to the Eligible Assets by 
limiting the total issued amount of the bond 
proceeds to 80% of the Eligible Assets.

institutions which are rated ‘Prime’ by ISS-
oekom. 
Hereto, on at least a quarterly basis,

Treasury for the distribution of an amount 
equivalent to these proceeds towards 
Eligible Assets or to be invested in short 
term money market products as explained 
above.
