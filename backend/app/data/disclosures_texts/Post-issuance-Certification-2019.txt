ISS  ESG ’s  VERIFICATION PROCESS  
ISS ESG is one of the world’s leading independent environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
research, analysis and rating houses. The company has been actively involved in the sustainable 
capital markets for over 25 years. Since 2014, ISS ESG has built up a reputation as a highly-reputed 
thought leader in the green and social bond market and has become one of the first CBI approved 
verifiers.  
ISS ESG has been conducted this independent Post-Issuance Verification Process of the green bond 
to be issued by de Volksbank based on the Climate Bond Standards 2.1. and in line with the limited 
assurance procedure defined by the International Standard on Assurance Engagements other than 
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000). 
ISS ESG’s approach is to assess whether the issuer’s Green Bond meets the criteria of the Climate 
Bond Standards 2.1. is as follows: 
 The issuer provided an overview over the assets to be included in the Green Bond asset pool and 
the relevant processes and documentation regarding the proceeds (e.g. use of proceeds, 
management of proceeds) to ISS ESG.  
 The issuer filled in a questionnaire that covers all criteria of the Climate Bonds Standard 2.1.  
 The issuer provided background documents that elaborate further on the information 
mentioned in the questionnaire.  
 Using the questionnaire and background documents, ISS ESG carried out an assessment of the 
CBI criteria. In case any answers were unclear, ISS ESG contacted the issuer for more details and 
clarification. 
The engagement with de Volksbank took place in October 2020. 
ISS  ESG’s BUSINESS PRACTICES  
ISS has conducted this verification in strict compliance with the ISS Code of Ethics, which lays out 
detailed requirements in integrity, transparency and objectivity for the ISS business and team 
members. It is designed to ensure that the verification is conducted independently and without any 
conflicts of interest with other parts of the ISS Group.  
RESTRICTION ON DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REPORT  
This Verification Report for Climate Bonds Certification including all documentation provided 
alongside is intended for the use of de Volksbank and the Climate Bonds Standard Board. The 
present document may be published by de Volksbank, CBI and ISS ESG. CBI and ISS ESG agree to

OPINION  
Based on the limited assurance procedures conducted and evidence obtained, nothing has come to 
our attention that causes us to believe that, in all material respects, the de Volksbank’s Green Bond 
is not in conformance with the Climate Bonds Standard’s Post-Issuance Requirements.
