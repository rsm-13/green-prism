By the end of 2024, Climate Bonds had recorded 
USD6.9tn of cumulative GSS and SLB (collectively 
GSS+) volume, of which USD5.7tn (83%) was 
found to be aligned. This indicates strong appetite 
for thematic debt, with the difference between 
the two numbers highlighting the rigour of 
Climate Bonds curation. 
This report describes the shape and size of the 
aligned GSS+ debt market as of 31 December 2024.
About the Climate  
Bonds Initiative
Climate Bonds is an international 
organisation working to mobilise global 
capital for climate action. It promotes 
investment in projects and assets needed for 
a rapid transition to a low-carbon, climate-
resilient, and fair economy. The mission 
focus is to help drive down the cost of capital 
for large-scale climate and infrastructure 
projects and to support governments 
seeking increased capital markets 
investment to meet climate and greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emission reduction goals. 
Climate Bonds conducts market analysis 
and policy research; undertakes market 
development activities; advises governments 
and regulators; and administers a global 
green bond Standard and Certification 
scheme. Climate Bonds screens green 
finance instruments against its global 
Taxonomy to determine alignment, and 
shares information about the composition 
of this market with partners. The Climate 
Bonds team has also expanded its analysis 
to other thematic areas, such as social and 
sustainability bonds via the development of 
screening methodologies for investments that 
give rise to positive social impacts and added 
resilience. Certification against the Climate 
Bonds Standard (CBS) represents about 10% 
of global green bond market volumes. This 
scheme is underpinned by rigorous scientific 
sector-specific Criteria to ensure that Certified 
bonds and issuers are consistent with the 1.5°C 
target of the Paris Agreement. Obtaining and 
maintaining Certification requires initial and 
ongoing third-party verification to ensure the 
assets meet the metrics of Sector Criteria.
Climate Bonds 
Standard and 
Certification 
Scheme
In 2023, the scope of the 
Climate Bonds Standard and Certification 
Scheme expanded beyond use of proceeds 
(UoP) instruments to assets, entities and 
sustainability-linked debt. The Climate Bonds 
Standard now covers the whole range of 
sustainable financing methods, including 
green equity, transition finance, general 
purpose debt and performance-linked 
instruments. The Certification label provides 
investors with assurance that the transition 
plans of a company or an SLB issuer are 
credible and based on science-based 
climate goals, and that strong governance 
practices have been adopted.
Following two further enhancements to the 
Standard in early 2024 (CBS v4.1 and v4.2), 
the Certification label can now be offered to:
1. early-stage R&D into new emission-
reducing technologies,
2. planned assets, allowing asset owners 
to demonstrate alignment of their green 
projects with science-based Sector Criteria 
during the development stage, and
3. DCF agrifood entities, showcasing their 
deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) 
supply chains.
The Climate Bonds Standard and 
Certification Scheme is a globally applicable 
integrated approach aligned with the 
best practice standards that supports the 
mobilisation of sustainable and transition 
finance towards a net-zero future.

Green municipal (muni) 
issuers from the USA were 
busy in 2024 as the volume 
priced by states, cities and 
local government bodies 
reached USD22.6bn, a 22% increase from 
USD18.6bn in 2023, marking a record 
high. California was the most active 
with USD12.8bn, or 57% of the volume, 
originating from institutions across the state. 
Fourteen Californian governmental bodies 
placed 20 green muni series in total, with 
the California Community Choice Financing 
Authority (CCCFA) being the largest issuer 
and pricing USD9.1bn in 2024. This equates 
to 40% of the total muni volume from the 
USA over the year. All green munis issued by 
the CCCFA are project revenue bonds.  
The CCCFA is an organisation created in 2021 
with the goal of reducing the cost-of-power 
purchases for member community choice 
aggregators (CCAs). These are programmes that 
allow local authorities in the region of southern 
California to purchase electricity on behalf of 
residential, commercial, and industrial users 
within their service area, through pre-payment 
structures.1 This is an innovative approach 
compared to the investor-owned utilities such 
as Southern California Edison. 
All green munis issued by CCCFA are used 
to finance the prepayment of ‘renewable’ 
electricity, primarily generated from solar, 
wind, and hydroelectric, via power purchase 
agreements (PPAs). A PPA is a long-term 
contract signed between a buyer and a seller 
wherein the former buys electricity supply 
from the latter which is typically an energy 
generator. The structure of PPAs not only 
promotes investment in renewable energy 
generation facilities but also has the advantage 
of ensuring price stability and predictability 
for buyers, as the contracts specify pre-
determined electricity prices, and buyers do 
not need capital investments on electricity 
generation infrastructure. The demand for 
clean PPAs is on the rise, especially among 
hyperscalers such as data centre operators, 
as PPAs have become the primary clean 
energy procurement method for these 
customers.2,3
California is frequently ravaged by wildfires 
while also being vulnerable to other impacts 
from climate change. Hence, the state is 
at the forefront of climate finance in the 
USA, and it recently approved USD10bn of 
spending in November 2024 on projects 
including water resilience, biodiversity 
protection, wildfire prevention etc., financed 
by general obligation bonds.4
volume, led by the EU which added EUR19.32bn 
(USD20.92bn) through one new issue and four 
reopenings of its green bonds. Sovereigns were 
dominant in the top ten largest issuers claiming 
six of the top ten places. 
Aligned green bonds originated from Croatia, 
Sri Lanka, and Tanzania for the first time in 
2024, further diversifying the ever-increasing 
investment pool. Entities from 98 countries have 
now priced 30,653 aligned green debt instruments.

A total of 3,242 aligned green bonds were 
recorded in 2024, an increase of 7.5% compared 
to 3,015 in 2023. There was a 38% increase 
in the number of such deals originating from 
Europe, which rose to 964 versus 698 in 2023. 
This translated into a 16.8% rise in volume 
to USD388.4bn from USD332.3bn. The three 
most prolific issuers by deal count in 2024 were 
Fannie Mae (205 deals with combined volume 
of USD8.08bn versus 83 deals and USD2.8bn 
in 2023), New York Metropolitan Transport

Representatives from 2023’s new country sources 
also priced deals in 2024, including Cyprus, 
Uzbekistan, and Zambia. Asia-Pacific was the 
second most prolific region for 2024 green bond 
volume, as it was in 2023, contributing 24% of 
the total aligned volume (USD160bn) with 43% 
of which coming from China. Aligned volume 
from LAC increased 27.5% YOY, Brazil’s Raizen 
Energia SA recorded the largest volume in that 
region with USD2.5bn across three bonds. 
Following a strong year in 2023, issuance 
volume from Africa fell 25% to USD1.35bn, with 
the African Development Bank accounting for 
the majority (USD0.94bn).  
Green issuance from North America (which 
includes the USA and Canada) picked up 
significantly with a YOY increase of 51% 
compared to 2023 when it experienced a dip. 
The North American aligned volume recorded 
in 2024 was USD104.7bn which is just slightly 
below the record issuance year of 2021 
(USD105.9bn). From North America, California 
Community Choice Financing Authority 
(CCCFA) was the largest contributor for the 
second consecutive year with USD9.1bn, a 
significant increase on USD5.9bn in 2023.

The top 10 aligned green debt issuers league 
table remains dominated by sovereigns, 
with the first three places taken by the EU, 
Germany, and the UK. Similarly, 2023 saw 
the UK, Germany and Italy take the top three 
spots. Two development banks claimed two of 
the top three places if sovereigns are excluded.
The USA is the leading  
country source 
The USA claimed the top position in the aligned 
green bond market in 2024, with USD84.7bn 
priced over 1,413 deals, which reflects an 
average deal size of USD59.9m. Once again, this 
demonstrates the prevalence of smaller deals 
from numerous issuers, given the average deal 
size of USD48.6m in 2023. 
Germany ranked second with USD73.3bn of 
aligned volume, or 11% of the total, and an 
increase of 11% YOY. The top two issuers, the 
German government and KfW, accounted for 
over 40% of the volume originating from Germany, 
together pricing USD32.6bn across 25 deals.

Q4 2024: A busy green bond quarter for China’s big four banks  
The four largest commercial 
banks in China are Bank 
of China (BoC), China 
Construction Bank (CCB), 
Agricultural Bank of China 
(ABC) and Industrial and Commercial 
Bank of China (ICBC), all of which are 
majority owned by the Chinese government. 
These four play a substantial role in China’s 
financial system and are also at the frontier 
of sustainable finance. Q4 2024 marked 
one of the busiest quarters for green bond 
transactions from these banks as three 
of them priced five deals with combined 
volume of USD8.61bn.  
BoC Paris Branch priced a USD300m, 3-year 
offshore green bond, financing solar and 
wind projects across France, Portugal, and 
Spain. In the domestic market, there were 
3-year and 4-year benchmark transactions 
from ICBC in December totalling CNY30bn 
(USD4.13bn) with proceeds earmarked for 
solar and wind power generation, and public 
transport. CCB and BoC came to the market 
with CNY20bn (USD2.81bn) in October 
and CNY10bn (USD1.37bn) green bonds 
in December, respectively, also financing 
renewable energy and public transport. 
All green projects financed by these domestic 
transactions comply with the eligibility 
criteria listed in the Green Bond Endorsed 
Projects Catalogue (2021), which is a 
classification system introduced by Chinese 
regulators to set green finance standards in 
the Chinese market and has seen significant 
uptake among issuers in various sectors 
since its introduction.5 The Common Ground 
Taxonomy (CGT), jointly launched by the 
International Platform on Sustainable 
Finance (IPSF) with the support of China and 
the EU at COP26 is another impactful climate 
change mitigation-focused sustainable 
finance classification system adopted by 
several Chinese issuers.6 As of the end of 
August 2024, 340 Chinese green bonds were 
deemed to comply with the CGT .7 
Chinese green bond issuers typically pre-
identify qualifying projects for inclusion in 
sustainable instruments and disclose the 
asset pool at issuance. Low-carbon energy 
and public transport projects are extremely 
popular green project categories for Chinese 
banks. Climate Bonds data shows that the 
big four banks had priced 126 green bond 
transactions totalling USD90.8bn at the end 
of 2024, and USD67.1bn, or 74%, had been 
earmarked for these two project categories, 
in particular solar and wind power 
generation facilities, and the construction 
and operation of subways. Such projects 
have become more prominent over the past 
two years, as the proportion increased to 
92% of the UoP raised from green bonds 
issued in or after 2022.

Hard currencies prevail 
EUR dominated the green debt market for 
the seventh consecutive year with 48% of the 
aligned volume amounting to USD323.9bn 
across 515 instruments. The USD was the 
second most prominent currency accounting 
for USD134.8bn of the volume from 1,543 
instruments. Of the aligned green volume, 85% 
came from five currencies: EUR, USD, CNY, GBP , 
and SEK. The EUR, USD, CNY, and GBP held the 
top four positions as was also the case in 2023 
and 2022. 
The EUR recorded the largest YOY increase 
among the top five currencies in terms of 
aligned green debt issued, rising from 44% 
in 2023 to 48% in 2024. Aligned green debt 
instruments from the EU and sovereigns 
from Germany, France, Italy and Austria 
all contributed to this increase, together 
accounting for over 25% of the aligned EUR 
green debt priced in 2024. 
The INR, which experienced a massive surge 
in 2023 placing fifth, fell back to 14th place in 
2024. Deals dominated in the Dominican peso 
(DOP) and the Tanzanian shilling (TZS) for the 
first time in 2024 were well received by the 
aligned green bond market. 
Private sector introduced more 
than half the green volume 
Private sector issuers in the non-financial 
and financial corporate sectors priced 51% of 
the green volume in 2024 (USD344bn). Non-
financial corporate issuers contributed 30% of 
the 2024 market share across 763 aligned green 
instruments from 418 issuers amassing a sum 
of USD202bn. 
The US renewable energy and transmission 
infrastructure company, Pattern Energy, 
priced the largest single non-financial 
corporate deal, with its USD8.8bn green 
loan, which was the most significant part of a 
USD11bn non-recourse financing package. The 
financing included an integrated construction 
loan and letter of credit facility, two separate 
term facilities, an operating phase letter of 
credit facility, an innovative tax equity term 
loan facility, and a holding company loan 
facility. The UoP was earmarked to finance 
the construction of SunZia Transmission and 
SunZia Wind, which together represent the 
largest clean energy infrastructure project in 
US history.8
Financial-corporate issuers emerged as the 
second largest issuer type with a 21% share 
of aligned green volumes, down from 27% 
in 2023. The 670 instruments amounted to 
USD142bn. The largest three issuers were 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 
(USD5.87bn), Volkswagen (USD5.3bn), 
and China Construction Bank Corporation 
(USD4.1bn).
Aligned volume from sovereigns (20%) and 
government-backed entities (19%) placed a 
close third and fourth, respectively. Germany 
made the largest contribution (USD19bn) to the 
sovereign segment while the EU was the largest 
government-backed entity issuer (USD20.9bn).
SPO volume increases
Second-party opinion (SPO) was the preferred 
type of external review in 2024, with an increase 
YOY in both the volume reviewed (+10%) and 
the number of instruments assessed (+18%) 
indicating both issuer and investor demand 
for the service. Norway, France, and Canada 
exhibited the largest increase in bonds

acknowledges this progress.  Investors are 
increasingly demanding impartial evidence of 
the validity of the environmental credentials 
of green bonds, indicating a heightened 
awareness of greenwashing risks. Issuers are 
also eager to steer clear of liabilities resulting 
from potential errors.

Transparency & Reporting in the GSS Bond Market 
The Transparency & Reporting in the 
GSS Bond Market report contains many 
interesting results from the analysis 
conducted, showcases best practice 
examples, and provides recommendations 
as to what can be done to drive progress.9 
Climate Bonds assessed GSS deals priced 
from 2020–2023, totalling USD1.4tn issued, 
which covered over 5,000 bonds where 
all deals analysed were considered to be 
aligned with Climate Bonds Green and Social 
& Sustainability Methodologies. The survey 
sample covers 75 of the largest global issuers 
of GSS bonds across all issuer types during 
that period.  
The analysis revealed that while the quality 
of reporting varies widely it is generally 
good and has improved since Climate 
Bonds’ 2021 study. 
Highlights: 
There were increased levels of commitment 
to report across the issuer sample surveyed. 
 • Of the issuers surveyed, 93% committed to 
report both allocations and impacts. 
 • Dedicated GSS reports were published  
by 91% of issuers, often annually, of  
which 60% made them accessible and 
easy-to-find. 
 • By issuer type, sovereigns and local 
governments demonstrated an improvement 
in transparency of reporting, as well as the 
adoption of best practices, building on the 
findings in the study in 2021.  
 • ICMA’s project classification was by far the 
most frequently used to categorise projects 
with 80% of issuers surveyed referencing and 
relying upon ICMA’s guidance and principles. 
Additionally, while impact reporting still lags 
allocation reporting in many aspects ICMA’s 
Harmonised Framework for Impact Reporting 
was the most frequently cited. 
Climate Bonds makes a series of 
recommendations within the report for 
high-quality and standardised reporting, and 
proposes the following four elements as a 
minimum: 
 • Scope – the need to report both allocations 
and impact. 
 • Bond identification – the scope of reports 
in terms of instruments and period covered, 
percentage of proceeds allocated, and the 
associated impact should be clearly stated. 
 • Accessibility to disclosure – making 
disclosure easy to locate. 
 • Frequency and timing – consistent and clear.  
In 2024, 43 SPO providers were involved 
in providing reviews for aligned green 
instruments. CICERO reviewed 485 instruments 
(versus 445 in 2023) followed by Sustainalytics 
with 340 instruments (versus 272 in 2023).

4. Social and sustainability 
Social and sustainability bond 
market highlights of 2024
 • In 2024, the aligned volume of social and 
sustainability (S&S) labelled debt increased 
for the first time since 2021, rising by 20.6% 
(USD373.9bn) compared to 2023. Prior to 
2024, the volume of S&S bonds had reduced 
by an average of 15.6% from 2021, which 
recorded the highest annual recorded 
issuance of S&S bonds at USD441.7bn.
 • In 2024, social bond volume increased by 9% 
to USD167.6bn from USD153.5bn in 2023.
 • Sustainability volume increased by 32% to 
USD206.3bn in 2024 from USD156.5bn in 
2023. Just under USD1tn (USD 998.1bn) in 
sustainability-labelled debt has been priced 
since 2008.
 • Government-backed entities were the 
most significant contributor to aligned S&S 
volume, accounting for 33% of the total 
(USD123.8bn), followed by development 
banks, which priced 27% (USD101.5bn).
Sustainability
Development banks  
drive growth in the 
sustainability market 
In 2024, the sustainability theme 
constituted 19% of aligned 
GSS+ deals. Aligned sustainability volume 
reached USD206.3bn, a 31% increase compared 
to 2023 (USD156.5bn). This growth came from 
development banks, which accounted for 41.8% 
of the aligned volume of sustainability deals 
issued in 2024 (USD86.2bn). While this was not the 
highest volume of sustainability bond issuance 
from development banks, it returned to similar 
levels reached during the COVID-19 pandemic 
in 2020, where development banks issued 
USD96.7bn of sustainability-labelled debt.
Aligned volumes increased from other issuer 
types too. Non-financial corporate entities 
including Malaysian Rail Link (MYR4bn/
USD1.5bn), Compass Group (EUR1.3bn/
USD1.4bn), and American Movil (MXN20bn/
USD1.2bn) collectively accounted for 12.7% 
of aligned sustainability volume in 2024 
(USD26.3bn), a 40% increase from 2023. In 2024, 
a further 100 non-financial corporates issued 
sustainability bonds in the market compared 
to 2023. Additionally, 120 entities issued 
their debut sustainability bonds contributing 
USD42.7bn; in comparison to 106 entities which 
priced aligned deals for the first time in 2023, 
with a collective volume of USD34.5bn.
Europe lags in sovereign issuance of 
sustainability bonds
Since 2008, Europe has surpassed all other 
regions as the source of the most aligned 
cumulative volume of sustainability bonds, 
reaching USD219.5bn. In 2024, Europe 
contributed 14.3% of aligned sustainability 
volume, however, issuance from the region has 
been declining since its 2021 peak of USD45.7bn. 
In 2024, European entities collectively priced 
sustainability volume of USD29.4bn. More 
recently, European entities have recorded 13x 
more volume in green bonds versus sustainability 
bonds. While the region retains its reputation 
for being the hub of sustainable finance as 
indicated by its 45% share of total GSS+ issuance 
in 2024, European sovereign sustainability bond 
issuance is low compared to other regions. 
In 2024, aligned sovereign sustainability 
bond issuance from Europe contributed 
just USD1.5bn, a significantly lower amount 
compared to that from LAC (USD15bn). Of the 
50 countries in Europe, only seven have priced 
a sovereign sustainability bond, which could 
be explained by the greater number of green 
bond appropriate projects (to which to allocate 
funds) available to European sovereigns.
The Asia-Pacific region overtook the LAC region 
as the largest source of sustainability-labelled 
debt in 2024, accounting for 29% of aligned 
sustainability volume (USD59.1bn). Aligned 
volume from Asia Pacific increased by nearly 
USD24bn compared to 2023, where China was 
the largest contributor with USD13.2bn in aligned 
sustainability volume, 310% higher than 2023.

The USA is the largest  
country source
In 2024, USD206.3bn of aligned sustainability-
labelled debt originated from 49 countries, 
eight of which were represented in the 
sustainability market for the first time. For 
comparison, in 2023, sustainability deals 
originated from 44 countries. The largest 
contribution came from the USA at USD14.2bn, 
driven by government-backed entities which 
collectively issued 574 sustainability bonds 
in 2024. China made the second largest 
contribution (USD13.2) from 44 issuers, and 
Mexico was third (USD13bn) with aligned deals 
from 10 issuers. 
In 2024, the US, China, and the UK were the 
only major markets demonstrating growth in 
S&S bonds. The total aligned volume of S&S 
bonds from China increased from USD13bn 
in 2023 to USD22.6bn in 2024, making it the 
sixth largest S&S market, following SNAT, 
USA, South Korea, Japan, and France.  
The alignment rate improved significantly 
in 2024, rising from 29% in 2023 to 70% 
in 2024 of amount issued, marking a new 
record high and further aligning the Chinese 
market with international standards. The 
aggregate issuance of sustainability bonds 
has surpassed that of social bonds, with the 
total issuance volume of S&S bonds in China 
increasing by 73.5% year-on-year, growing 
from USD13bn in 2023 to USD22.6bn in 2024. 
In August 2024, Zhuji Development 
Ltd priced the year’s largest aligned 
sustainability bond in the Chinese 
market. The UoP of the USD520m deal 
was earmarked to support affordable 
infrastructure, affordable housing, green 
buildings, buildings, and water projects.  
There are three reasons behind  
the market growth:  
1. S&S bonds are viewed by China’s financial 
industry as having the potential to offer a 
new growth area for financing tools with 
positive social effects. 
2. Chinese sustainable finance practitioners, 
especially investment bankers who support 
bond issuers, have developed a better 
understanding of sustainable finance and are 
now more aligned with international standards. 
3. More issuers use second-party opinion (SPO) 
providers when issuing bonds. According to

The World Bank
SNAT was the largest source of aligned 
sustainability volume in 2024 with USD77.9bn. 
The largest issuers were the World Bank 
(USD54.3bn), the International Development 
Association (USD11.1bn), and the Inter-
American Development Bank (USD8.1bn). 
In 2024, the World Bank was the largest issuer 
in the GSS+ market, and the largest single 
source of sustainability bonds accounting for 
26% of the volume. It priced 262 deals across 
18 different currencies evenly distributed 
over each quarter of the year. Since 2022, 
the World Bank has progressively increased 
presence in the sustainability bond market, 
reaching cumulative volume of USD300bn by 
the end of 2024. Through sustainability bonds 
in local currencies such as KZT (Kazakhstani 
tenge) and UYU (Uruguayan peso), the World 
Bank is working alongside the International 
Development Association and its Private Sector 
Window to establish credible market solutions 
to support inclusive investments that address

AUD, and CAD) contributed 81% of the aligned 
sustainability bond volume (USD168bn). 
In line with 2023, the USD dominated, with 
52% of all sustainability deals priced in USD, 
86% of which originated outside of the USA. 
USD sustainability volume increased by 66%

Social
In 2024, aligned social bonds 
contributed 16% to GSS+ 
volume. The volume of social 
bonds reached USD167.6bn, 
an increase of 9.1% compared 
to the USD153.5bn recorded 
in 2023. 
There were 82 new issuers in 2024, which 
collectively contributed USD35.9bn. 
Issuers of social bonds also emerged from the 
following countries for the first time: UAE, El 
Salvador, Bolivia, and Mongolia. The Korea 
Housing Finance Corporation (KHFC) was 
the largest social bond issuer in 2024, issuing 
USD14.8bn, or 9% aligned volume. 
Since 2018, KHFC has priced cumulative aligned 
volume of USD151.8bn making it the largest 
source of social bonds. French government-
backed entity Caisse d’Amortissement de 
la Dette Sociale (CADES) is second with 
cumulative social volume of USD143.3bn. 
Social bond issuance, Europe 
leads but the USA bounces back
In 2024, Europe became the largest source 
of aligned social bonds contributing 31% 
(USD51.8bn). While this is lower than the 
volume priced in 2023 (USD54.8bn), Europe 
welcomed 15 new social bond issuers to the 
market, contributing USD5.2bn in 2024. Both 
Asia Pacific and Europe recorded a decline in 
social bond volume.
North America reported a 147% increase in 
2024 compared to 2023 (USD20bn), which 
was almost exclusively attributed to issuers 
in the USA accounting for 99% of the social 
bond volume. Meanwhile in 2024, Canadian 
issuers only contributed USD0.5bn. The USA’s 
increase in aligned social volume comes 
from government-backed entities such as 
Government National Mortgage Association 
(Ginnie Mae), Government National 
Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation 
(Freddie Mac).

Iceland and Slovenia enter the 
social bond market
 • In 2024, issuance volume in the social bond 
market was driven by government-backed 
entities which accounted for 61% of all 
aligned social bonds (USD102.6bn).
 • Sovereign issuers priced aligned social 
volume of USD7.7bn in 2024, a 30% increase 
YOY. The market welcomed two new 
sovereign issuers, Slovenia (USD346m) and 
Iceland (USD53.5m). Iceland’s social bond 
was issued to finance areas addressing 
gender-equality for example increasing the 
supply of affordable housing for low-income 
women, marking a first for the sovereign debt 
market.18 As one of the world’s most gender-
equality progressive countries, Iceland has 
positioned its sustainable finance framework 
to fund eligible projects that extend to social 
inclusion and improve the conditions for 
gender minorities.19 
External review
 • In 2024, 22 SPO providers reviewed social 
bonds, covering 74% of the social bond 
volume, with five SPO providers reviewing 
social bonds for the first time: EY, Lianhe 
Equator, MARC Ratings, IBIS, and Pacific 
Corporate Sustainability (PCS). The top five 
SPO providers by number of instruments 
covered were Sustainalytics (864), Kestel 
(605), S&P Global Ratings (353), Korea Ratings 
(106), and KIS Ratings.
Ginnie Mae
 • Ginnie Mae issued the second largest volume 
of aligned social bonds in 2024 (USD14.5bn). 
As a debut social bond issuer in 2024, Ginnie 
Mae issued 1,253 deals, the highest number 
of social bonds issued by a single entity in 
one year. Prior to 2024, Ginnie Mae had only 
been active in the green bond market.
 • Ginnie Mae is a government corporation 
within the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, whose role is to 
connect global capital markets to America’s 
housing finance system. It has a social impact 
and sustainability commitment to serve 
communities and households that fall under 
its target population, which includes first-
time homeowners, low-to-moderate income 
households, veterans, seniors, and members 
of urban, rural, and tribal communities.13
 • In 2023, Ginnie Mae launched a social bond 
label for investors looking to invest capital in 
its single-family mortgage-backed security 
programme, providing additional disclosure 
data to determine the social impact of 
its instruments.14  This was ultimately a 
response to investor requests for greater 
transparency on social data within the 
organisation’s mortgage pool.15
BancoSol prices the first social 
bond in the Bolivian currency
In 2024, Boliviano (BOB) and Jamaican dollars

BancoSol, the first regulated bank in Bolivia 
dedicated to microfinance, issued one aligned 
social bond in BOB (USD29m) which is the 
second time a thematic bond had been priced 
in BOB, following a green bond from Banco de 
Desarrollo Productivo in 2023. 
BancoSol was founded in 1992 and as of 
June 2024, was serving over one million 
entrepreneurs in the Bolivian micro and 
small business sector, providing microcredit 
to Bolivian families excluded from the 
conventional financial system. With the 
support of IDB Invest, BancoSol issued Bolivia’s 
first social gender bond in the Bolivian stock 
market, with IDB Invest providing a partial 
credit guarantee of 50% of the issuance 
amount.16 Resources funded through the 
bond will enable BancoSol to expand access 
to financing for businesses led by Bolivian 
women, closing economic gaps that currently 
burden BancoSol’s female customers who 
make up 45% of the bank’s credit clients.17

A robust framework for assessing social 
and sustainability bonds with the aim 
of promoting impact-driven finance and 
going beyond green UoP . 
The Climate Bonds Social & Sustainability 
Bond Dataset (SSBD) covers two main types 
of debt instruments, which are classified 
based on the projects or activities they 
finance: 
1. Social bonds allocate 100% of net 
proceeds to projects that address or 
mitigate specific social issues and generate 
positive social outcomes, targeting 
underserved or vulnerable populations. 
Some social projects may also deliver 
environmental co-benefits. The issuer 
should classify a bond as a social bond 
based on the primary objectives of the 
underlying projects. 
2. Sustainability bonds intentionally 
combine green and social projects, 
reflecting a broader commitment to both 
environmental and social impact. 
Strengthening transparency and 
credibility in the GSS+ market 
The updated methodology offers a robust, 
reliable framework for assessing the full 
spectrum of impact finance, ensuring greater

transparency and credibility in social and 
sustainability bonds. It provides clear guidance 
for investors, issuers, and other stakeholders 
in evaluating the social and environmental 
impact of bonds. By fostering best practices in 
the GSS+ market, the methodology supports 
efforts to address critical social challenges, such 
as poverty, hunger, healthcare access, education 
and inequalities, while driving the transition to a 
low-carbon, climate-resilient, and just economy. 
Key updates: 
1. Enhanced assessment framework  
A refined approach to evaluating the 
effectiveness of UoP , using an inclusive, 
bottom-up method that strengthens 
transparency in reporting and mitigates 
impact washing. 
2. Comprehensive UoP mapping  
A structured classification of eligible 
UoP categories, linking them to relevant 
SDGs, ICMA categories and key indicators, 
improving clarity and consistency in bond 
assessments. 
3. A 10% margin of flexibility  
A newly introduced flexibility margin 
accommodates cases where metrics or 
alignment are uncertain, ensuring a more 
adaptable and practical assessment approach. 
This methodology is an essential tool for 
those navigating the evolving GSS+ market, 
helping to assess the credibility of social and 
sustainability bonds with confidence.

affects ‘not in line with pathway’ figures.21
Sustainability-linked bond 
market findings 2024
 • In 2024, aligned SLBs contributed under 1% 
to GSS+ volume. 
 • Aligned SLB volume exhibited a 65% decrease, 
falling to USD7.9bn compared to USD22.8bn 
recorded for 2023, with the overall SLB volume 
captured dropping by 38%.  
 • The percentage of the aligned amount 
issued fell to 19% in 2024 from 35% in 2023, 
which points to the potential for the aligned 
SLB market to expand. While the market is 
maturing the aligned percentage is struggling 
to gain ground.
 • In 2024, the Thai government issued the first 
ASEAN sovereign SLB, a THB30bn (USD868m) 
fully aligned 15.5year bond. 
Assessing credibility  
and ambition through  
SLBD alignment
An in-depth analysis of structural SLB features 
and transition plans is beyond the scope of 
this report but was included in Climate Bonds’ 
dedicated SLBD report released in March 
2024.22 Its primary objective is to help users, 
particularly investors, identify deals with 
targets that are credible and aligned with the 
‘well below 2°C’ goal of the Paris Agreement, 
as well as to highlight best practice and 
guide issuers. The assessment methodology 
incorporates some aspects of Climate Bonds 
Standard version 4.2 (CBS v4.2), including the 
Climate Bonds Sector Criteria where available.23
The SLBD screens deals under a 
methodology that classifies SLBs as 
aligned or not aligned based on multiple 
requirements. Three categories for aligned 
bonds exist:
 • Fully aligned: targets are aligned with the 
sector-specific pathway (emissions below 
required threshold).
 • Strongly aligned: targets are not currently 
aligned but will be by 2030.
 • Aligning: targets do not meet the absolute/
intensity threshold but are aligned on a 
percentage reduction basis.
A large proportion of the market does not 
meet the SLBD alignment requirements. Of 
the cumulative 17% of SLB volume issued and 
13% of the SLBs priced that do, the vast majority 
are fully aligned (87% of the aligned volume). 
Reasons for non-alignment
Lack of GHG targets and partial GHG scope 
coverage account for 78% of the non-aligned 
volume issued, 73% of the non-aligned bonds, 
and 71% of the non-aligned issuers. The ranking 
of non-alignment reasons has remained 
broadly similar every year since 2020.24
Lack of GHG targets is the top reason for non-
alignment by bond and issuer count, while 
partial GHG scope coverage is the leading 
reason by amount.25 Eight of the top ten issuers 
have all or most of their SLBs linked to KPIs or 
targets that do not include all GHG emissions, 
even though these often represent the largest 
source of GHG emissions in their sectors.  
Setting targets that are not in line with relevant 
pathways is fourth on the list of non-alignment 
reasons. Issuers should be setting sufficiently 
ambitious targets that meet Paris-aligned decar-
bonisation pathways (or at least meeting the same 
percentage reduction, i.e., considered aligning). 
Alignment drops from the record  
reached in 2023
The share of aligned SLBs dropped in 2024 
to USD7.9bn, equating to 19% of the amount 
issued and 11% of bonds (versus 35% and 
20% in 2023, respectively). The volume of 
SLBs captured and the number of SLBs issued 
fell significantly less than the corresponding 
aligned figures (38%, 8.5%) demonstrating 
challenges in the alignment aspect of SLBs.
The fall in aligned SLB volume YOY was driven 
by a decrease in volume from some of the 
largest sources of 2023-aligned SLBs.  Four of 
the largest sources in 2023 all demonstrated 
dramatic declines in issuance. Chile, which 
was the source of 37.5% of the aligned 2023 
SLB volume (USD8.6bn) priced just USD500m 
in 2024, similarly aligned SLB volume from 
France, Germany, and Denmark also 
dropped (accounting for declines of 52%, 50%, 
and 75%, respectively).
The Netherlands, Chile, and Finland were 
the only countries to price 100% aligned SLB 
volumes in 2024. The Netherlands and Chile 
demonstrated similarly robust alignment 
qualities in their 2023 SLBs. Germany, 
Denmark, and Sweden all declined YOY in 
terms of percentage of aligned volume issued, 
while France improved and increased the 
aligned volume issued from 51% to 76%.
Thailand and Turkey priced their first aligned 
SLBs in 2024; one from the sovereign and one 
from a corporate issuer, and both countries had 
previously issued non-aligned SLBs in recent 
years. In Thailand, the Thai Government issued 
its first SLB raising THB30bn (USD865m), which 
is linked to two sustainability performance 
targets which include a reduction of 30% in 
GHG emissions by 2030 and an increase in 
new registrations of zero-emission vehicles to 
440,000 per year by 2030. Thailand’s Precious 
Shipping also issued two USD20m aligned SLBs. 
Sustainable Debt Global State of the Market 2024  Climate Bonds Initiative
 18
In Turkey, agrifood business, Ulker Biskuvi 
Sanayi AS priced its debut USD550m SLB. Ulker 
published its sustainability-linked financing 
framework in May 2024 identifying two GHG 
emission reduction targets. The first target is 
to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
42% by 2030, and the second is a reduction in 
scope 3 emissions of 30% by 2030. Both targets 
have 2021 as their baseline.
While there are some promising signs for  
the SLB market, and Climate Bonds has 
supported the market’s development with  
policy recommendations, sector criteria, 
research, and engagement with issuers and 
investors,  challenges remain particularly 
regarding alignment.
SLB issuance by region
 • The share of SLBs originating from EM 
reached 38% of the volume and 61% of total 
SLBs by number (higher than 33% and 48%, 
respectively, in 2023) which is the highest 
since 2019.
 • In 2024, Europe was the largest source of 
SLB volume (56%, USD23bn), which was 
also reflected in the volume of aligned 
deals (USD5bn) making it by far the most 
significant contributor of all the regions. The 
three largest aligned issuers from the region 
were Goldstory, Carrefour, and Koninklijke 
Ahold Delhaize. 
 • Asia Pacific was the only region to grow YOY 
increasing from USD13.8bn over 109 bonds 
in 2023 to 14.8bn across 144 bonds in 2024. 
Asia Pacific ranked second accounting for 
15% of the SLB volume priced, driven by 
issuance from China (USD7bn); however, 
Thailand was the largest source of 
aligned SLB debt owed largely to the Thai 
Government Bond detailed earlier.
 • Latin American SLB issuance volume 
declined significantly falling from USD14.3bn 
in 2023 (37 deals) to USD2.7bn (16 deals) in 
2024. The decline was primarily driven by the 
fall in issuance from the two largest sources 
in 2023, Chile and Mexico.
 • North America was almost entirely absent 
in the 2024 SLB market with the exception 
of one deal from Canada’s Telus Corp, a 
communications company that priced a 
CAD500m (USD368m) SLB.
SLB issuance by country  
- Italy and China maintain  
their dominance 
 • In 2024, Italy was once again the largest 
source of SLBs by volume (25%, USD10.4bn) 
while China maintained its dominance 
pricing the highest count of SLBs, ranked 
second by volume. No issuers in either Italy 
or China priced any aligned SLBs in 2024 
but there was one Chinese SLB pending 
alignment at year end 2024.
 • Further down the SLB issuance by country 
volume rankings the alignment landscape 
becomes a little more optimistic. The third, 
fourth, and fifth places taken by Japan, 
Germany, and France demonstrated 
alignment of 16%, 34%, and 76%, respectively.
 • China maintained its dominance in bond 
and issuer counts, with SLBs accessed by 
a broader pool of relatively small issuers. 
Among the top ten issuer domiciles, 
China’s average bond size (USD86m) is only 
comparable to that of Japan (USD116m). 
Fourteen out of the twenty-seven SLB 
issuing countries priced SLBs with no 
alignment to Climate Bonds SLBD during 
2024, which was mainly due to a lack of GHG 
emission KPIs or targets.
 • The top three issuer domiciles cumulatively 
by amount issued in 2024 were Italy 
(USD10.4bn) with volume dominated by two 
issuers, ENEL and Snam); China (USD 7.1bn); 
and Japan (USD3.4bn).

Private sector dominance 
continues to grow
 • Non-financial and financial corporates 
continue to dominate the market, reaching 
91% of the volume issued cumulatively versus 
84% in 2023. Non-financial corporates were 
the source of 80% of the 2024 SLB market. 
 • While development banks were absent from 
the market in 2024, government-backed entity 
SLB volume increased YOY, volume priced 
by local government was stable, and there 
was only one sovereign SLB from Thailand 
representing the first sovereign ASEAN SLB 
(detailed in the sovereign section).
Wide range of economic sectors 
are represented
 • In 2024, the Climate Bonds SLBD recorded 
issues across nearly all economic sectors, 
with renewable energy the only absentee. 
This continued broad deployment highlights 
the flexibility of SLBs as general-purpose 
funding instruments. It also demonstrates 
that issuers in any economic sector 
can tie their financing commitments to 
decarbonisation ambitions even if they do 
not have specific green expenditures.
 • Industrials maintained their top position in 
2024 by a relatively wide margin across all 
metrics (amount issued, number of bonds, 
and number of issuers). Autostrade per 
l’Italia was the largest industrial issuer in 2024 
pricing USD1.1bn across two deals, neither of 
which was aligned due to the use of economic 
intensity (revenue) in KPIs or targets.

consumer discretionary, financials, and 
agrifood, which compares with industrials, 
government, oil and gas, agrifood, and

4. The sovereign GSS+ bond club 
As of the end of 2024, Climate Bonds had 
recorded cumulative aligned sovereign 
GSS+ volume of USD655.9bn from 59 
issuers. The total number of EM countries 
that priced aligned GSS+ sovereign debt 
grew to 37 (from 34 in 2023), and debuts 
from Australia, Iceland, and Japan in 2024 
pushed DM countries to 22. Green remains 
the largest theme, taking 80% of the 
cumulative volume.  
Sovereign GSS+ bond market 
highlights 2024
 • Sovereigns contributed 16% to aligned GSS+ 
volume in 2024. 
 • Aligned GSS+ deals amounting to USD167.4bn 
were issued by 37 countries, 4% more than the 
USD161.3bn recorded for 2023.  
 • Aligned sovereign GSS+ deals originated 
from all regions in 2024, led by Europe which 
delivered 60% of the volume. 
 • New instruments were priced by 29 countries, 
a further eight tapped existing deals, and 
16 countries increased their GSS+ liabilities 
through both new and existing deals.  
 • In November, Honduras became the 59th 
country to join the Sovereign GSS+ bond club 
with its USD700m sustainability deal. Six 
other countries priced aligned debut GSS+ 
deals in 2024 beginning in January with the 
Ivory Coast’s USD1.1bn sustainability deal. 
Japan priced two aligned GX Transition 
(green) bonds (JPY1.6tn, USD10.6bn). 
Romania priced EUR2.2bn and JPY33bn 
(USD2.4bn) of green bonds. Iceland priced 
a green bond (EUR750m, USD815m) and 
a social bond (EUR50m, USD54m). Both 
Australia (AUD7.6bn, USD5bn) and the 
Dominican Republic (USD750m) priced 
green bonds.  
Europe leads on sovereigns 
Regionally, Europe is the largest source of 
sovereign GSS+ debt, reaching cumulative aligned 
volume of USD437.6bn by the end of 2024, 
originating from 24 countries. Among the 27 EU 
member states, 18 have issued GSS+ instruments. 
During the year, USD101.9bn was priced 
across Europe, with the largest contributions 
coming from Germany (EUR17.5bn, USD19bn), 
UK (GBP13.5bn, USD17.3bn), and France 
(EUR14.1bn, USD15.3bn).

France retains poll position 
France is an innovator in sustainable finance 
and remains the largest source of sovereign 
GSS+ debt with its green liabilities standing 
at EUR76bn (USD84.9bn) by the end of 2024.26 
In January, France priced its fourth green 
sovereign. The EUR8bn (USD8.7bn) 2049 
maturity was priced by syndicate and obtained 
a EUR98bn (USD107bn) order book, covering 
the deal more than 12 times. This is on the 
higher end of the demand scale, and the 
longer tenor would have contributed to that. 
The French Treasury reported that 80% of the 
deal was allocated to investors describing 
themselves as green or socially responsible.27 
Climate Bonds research demonstrates that the 
deal obtained a marginal greenium or pricing 
benefit. The deal was reopened for EUR1.9bn 
(USD2.1bn) in October.  
Massive potential for 
governments to convert 
expenditures 
Most of the twenty largest issuers have massive 
potential to convert their expenditures 
to qualify for GSS+ funding. Despite a 
solid commitment to preferencing green 
expenditures, France’s green volume still only 
contributed 3% to its total liabilities at the 
end of 2024. Among the 20 largest sovereign 
GSS+ issuers, Chile is the only issuer to have 
deployed green, social, sustainability, and SLB 
instruments, which contributed 42% to its total 
liabilities at the end of 2024. Japan has already 
begun an ambitious issuance programme, but

USD is the preferred currency 
of EM sovereign issuers 
Sovereign issuers of aligned GSS+ deals have 
deployed 26 currencies, with 29 countries 
pricing in EUR which together with USD, and 
GBP collectively represents 81% of the total 
volume. While the USA is yet to price its first 
GSS+ treasury, 24 other countries have priced 
aligned deals in USD: one DM (Hong Kong, 
China) plus 23 EM countries.  
In 2024, 20 currencies were deployed. The 
fifth largest of those was AUD, which was the 
only new currency in the sovereign space, 
introduced by Australia for its AUD7.6bn 
(USD5bn) debut green bond.  
JPY took fourth place in 2024, with a 7% share 
of aligned GSS+ volume. Aside from Japan’s GX 
Transition bonds (JPY1.6tn, USD10.6bn), JPY was 
also the chosen currency of Hungary (JPY1.3bn, 
USD9m), Indonesia (JPY25bn, USD159m), 
Mexico (JPY152.2bn, USD1bn), Romania 
(JPY33bn, USD222.4m), and Slovenia (JPY50bn, 
USD347m). This reflects issuers leveraging 
strong Japanese investor demand for GSS+ 
labels to diversify their funding sources.  
Most sovereign volume is green
The green theme is the firm favourite of 
sovereign issuers, taking 80% of the cumulative 
aligned total. In 2024, 24 countries issued new 
green deals or taps, with combined volume 
of USD134.1bn, 9% more than USD123.5bn 
recorded in 2023.   
Sustainability volume grew by 3% to 
USD24.7bn in 2024 from USD24bn in 2023. 
Twenty sovereign issuers had priced aligned 
sustainability deals with combined volume 
of USD86bn by the end of 2024. Twelve EM 
governments accessed the market in 2024, led 
by Mexico which priced USD7.1bn in a mixture 
of taps and new deals in JPY, MXN, and EUR.  
Honduras became the 59th country and the 
twelfth from the LAC region to price a GSS+ deal 
when it issued its debut sustainability bond in 
November 2024. The USD700m ten-year deal 
referenced Honduras’ framework for green, 
social, and sustainable thematic bonds published 
earlier that same month.28 The 28 eligible project 
categories specified in the framework were 
selected for their potential to contribute to 
a reduction in poverty, or support climate action.  
The social theme has attracted combined 
aligned volume of USD33.7bn from seven 
sovereign issuers altogether, among which 
Iceland is the only DM. In 2024, the social theme 
experienced growth of 31% YOY, the strongest 
rise among the sovereign GSS+ themes, with 
volume reaching USD7.7bn compared to 
USD5.9bn the prior year. Repeat social issuers 
Chile (USD6bn from one new issue and two 
taps), and Colombia (USD1.3bn from two taps) 
were joined by newcomers Iceland (EUR50m, 
USD53m) and Slovenia (JPY50bn, USD346.6bn).  
Sovereign SLB issuance declined by 89% 
to USD868m compared to USD8bn priced 
by Chile in 2023. Thailand was the only 
source of sovereign SLB volume in 2024, 
and its November deal was the first from the 
ASEAN region. Thailand has two outstanding 
sustainability deals priced in 2020 and 2022. 
Its 2040 maturity THB30bn (USD868m) 
SLB references Thailand’s October 2024 
sustainability-linked financing framework 
and includes material KPIs with ambitious 
targets, given Thailand is an EM growing its 
economy through industrial production.29 
The achievement of the SPTs is supported by 
policy action, such as Thailand’s 2024 power 
development plan (explained in the framework), 
for use until 2037. It forms part of the national 
energy plan and states the intention to increase 
the share of energy from renewable sources 
to 51% by 2037 from 20% in 2023 in addition 
to measures that improve power supply 
management. The Thailand Board of Investment 
(BOI) has introduced several measures including 
policies, tax breaks, and non-tax incentives to 
raise EV use to 30% by 2030.30 While this deal 
encourages accountability from Thailand, 
larger coupon adjustments would enhance its 
credibility as an incentive.

Nationally determined 
contributions (NDCs) are 
the climate action plans of 
individual countries under the 
Paris Agreement, describing 
how they will decarbonise and adapt 
to climate change impacts. The Paris 
Agreement mandates that NDCs be updated 
every five years, with ambition ratcheting 
in each iteration. NDCs 3.0, due in 2025, will 
outline country level climate plans until 
2035. Updates are informed by the Global 
Stocktake, which assesses global progress 
toward the Paris Agreement goals. Countries 
can use this opportunity to stretch their 
mitigation and adaptation ambitions by 
enhancing the scope, depth, and urgency of 
their actions.
Only 13 out of 195 countries had submitted 
by the original 10 February deadline. Those 
countries were Andorra, Brazil, Ecuador, the 
Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Singapore, 
Saint Lucia, Switzerland, the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE), the UK, Uruguay, the United 
States, and Zimbabwe.31  
Among these, the UAE, Brazil, and 
Azerbaijan are expected to increase fossil 
fuel production up to 2035. 32 The UAE is one 
of the ten largest oil producing nations and 
has committed to reducing its emissions by 
47% by 2035 compared to a 2019 baseline. 
The territory plans a shift away from fossil 
fuels through solar capacity, waste to 
energy technologies, and nuclear energy. 
These activities can be financed through 
the green bond market and simultaneous 
plans to cut fossil fuel production and 
exports could engender the required 
credibility to obtain investor confidence 
and perhaps pricing benefits.  
Brazil’s NDC was strengthened to a 59-67% 
GHG emissions reduction on 2005 levels by 
2035, however it was evaluated by Climate 
Action Tracker to be insufficient, largely due to 
uncertainty over the LULUCF contribution.33  
The UK NDC, while ambitious at 78% 
by 2035, is undermined by doubts over 
policy backing. This is why it is crucial for 
ambitious NDCs to be backed by strong, 
fully costed, sovereign transition plans. 
Climate Bonds is developing guidance for 
sovereign transition planning, with a focus 
on how to unlock the financing needed to 
deliver targets.   
Nationally determined contributions: 2025 is the year to finance increased ambition 
Canada, Japan, Montenegro, Maldives, and Cuba 
had all submitted by the end of February. The 
UNFCCC extended the deadline for submissions 
to September 2025, urging countries to 
prioritise the quality of their climate action 
plans over meeting the initial deadline.34  
It is important to remember that while NDCs 
have a strong signalling effect regarding 
ambition, they are not binding and are just 
one tool which must be combined with and 
supported by robust policy and adequate, 
committed financing.  
The enhanced NDCs were required to provide 
improved targets for 2030 and 2035.    
However, several of those submitted did not 
increase 2030 targets, implying the need for 
substantial emissions reductions 2030–2035, 
for example by 41% in the UAE. This creates 
uncertainty over the ability of countries to 
meet such targets, again highlighting the 
need for strong policy backing of targets, and 
to demonstrate near-term action to inspire 
confidence in them.   
Financing NDCs is a major challenge for all 
parties but particularly for least developed 
countries (LDCs). Most countries have six 
options, each of which can be supported 
through the GSS+ market:  
1. Public finance. Many countries such as 
Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the UK 
have earmarked national budgets to invest in 
low-carbon technologies, renewable energy, 
and infrastructure i  mprovements. Such 
expenditures can be funded through the green 
bond market which would also attract private 
sector investment and stimulate local issuance. 
Fiscally constrained budgets can still be tilted 
to green, through fiscally efficient policies 
such as reallocating subsidies from fossil fuels 
to cleaner energy sources, as deployed by 
Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the UK, and 
Costa Rica among others.  
2. Public-private partnerships (PPP). 
Countries can leverage public investment 
to mobilise private investment, transfer 
technology, share risks, and scale climate 
action projects. PPPs ensure that countries 
can access a diversified financial base to meet 
their climate goals. The Ultra Mega Solar 
Power Project in Madhya Pradesh, India, which 
increased India’s solar energy generation 
capacity by 2.5% was the result of a successful 
PPP .35 The Netherlands has implemented PPPs 
such as its Room for the River project to 
address resilience to flooding.36 
3. Private investment. Policy action can 
stimulate private investment in NDC-aligned 
projects. This requires a comprehensive 
policy framework that tilts the playing field 
to green, providing the standards and targets 
for industrial sectors, developing demand 
and supply chain security, and smoothing 
investment processes.37 Much of this can be 
done at minimal cost to the public purse, 
although a certain level of public risk-sharing 
will be required.    
4. International climate finance. 
Developed countries have committed to 
providing financial support for developing 
countries to meet NDCs and national 
adaptation plans, with the annual goal 
recently increased from USD100bn to 
USD300bn by 2035 at COP29 in 2024.38This 
funding is channelled through mechanisms 
such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and 
the Global Environment Facility (GEF), with 
the goal of assisting countries to meet their 
NDC targets. Strong national transition 
planning can help developing countries to 
access these funds.  
5. Multilateral development banks 
(MDBs) and bilateral development finance 
institutions (DFIs): Organisations such as 
the World Bank and Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) play a crucial role in helping 
LDCs address their mitigation and 
adaptation priorities. They provide loans, 
grants, guidance, capacity building, and 
technical assistance to support climate 
ambitions. MDBs and DFIs can maximise 
their impact by prioritising private capital 
mobilisation whenever possible, rates of 
which are particularly low in LDC financing.39 
6. Carbon markets and climate finance 
mechanisms: Some countries like Mexico, 
China, and South Korea, or regions 
such as the EU deploy carbon markets/
emissions trading systems or carbon offset 
mechanisms. These allow them to invest in 
carbon reduction projects both domestically 
and internationally.

5. Blue- and water-labelled GSS+ market
Introduction
The blue label remained a considerable source 
of GSS+ bonds in 2024. While not quite matching 
the uptick witnessed in 2023 (+163%), GSS+ 
bonds with a blue theme collectively amounted 
to USD6.4bn across 37 instruments (versus 
USD7.4bn, 40 bonds in 2023). Estimates point 
to an investment opportunity of over USD3tn 
until 2050 for areas such as the decarbonisation 
of marine transportation, protection of marine 
and coastal ecosystems, marine renewable 
energy, and sustainable aquaculture.40 
Climate Bonds screens bonds bearing the 
blue label for its GBD (environmental UoP) 
and SSBD (social and environmental UoP) 
while SLBs from issuers with operations in 
the blue economy are eligible for inclusion 
in Climate Bonds SLBD. For example, a blue 
bond focused solely on green projects such as 
marine renewable energy, would be considered 
green-themed, whereas a blue bond including 
categories with inherent green and social 
characteristics, such as sustainable coastal 
and marine tourism, would be considered 
sustainability-themed. 
Climate Bonds reinforces the need for blue 
bond issuers to follow the appropriate ICMA 
principles according to the thematic nature of 
the stated UoP .41 
Blue bonds can be considered 
‘green’ or ‘sustainability’, 
according to their UoP categories 
(adapted from ICMA principles)
Scope of the analysis
The methodological approach for this 
research consists of data analysis of GSS+ 
bonds recorded in Climate Bonds’ three 
datasets: GBD, SSBD, and SLBD. Three 
different mapping exercises were done for 
this piece: 
1. A mapping of all bonds in which issuers 
labelled their bonds explicitly with blue 
and water tags according to publicly 
available information recorded in the 
different Climate Bonds datasets.
2. A mapping of bonds where Climate 
Bonds recorded water as one of the bond’s 
UoP categories.
3. A mapping of bonds meeting one of 
these three pre-defined criteria: bearing 
a blue or water label; or having water as 
one of its UoP categories as recorded in 
the Climate Bonds datasets; or having one 
keyword related to the blue economy in its 
UoP categories.42 
The results of the mappings demonstrate 
the potential of the blue label to expand 
within the current GSS+ market. The water 
label can be considered a subset of blue, 
and considered a blue label at the same 
time. Results show that several labelled 
debt instruments aside from blue and water 
bonds have already dedicated proceeds to 
projects and assets associated with different 
blue economy activities. 
The precise total capital flows towards blue 
sectors are difficult to map accurately because 
issuers do not always report the specific 
allocation of proceeds to different project 
categories in advance. Moreover, Climate 
Bonds datasets do not track post-issuance 
allocations but record flat allocations 
(i.e., equal amounts in each category) 
unless relevant data is available when the 
instrument is issued. Therefore, the results 
of this mapping exercise represent a proxy 
and do not reflect the actual capital flows 
being directed to blue economy investments 
through GSS+ bond instruments. 
Disclosure and tagging practices must evolve 
before Climate Bonds can capture and track 
blue-related finance with a greater degree of 
accuracy in the global thematic debt market. 
Using blue and water labels while adopting 
best practices regarding disclosure and 
technical eligibility criteria for projects and 
assets will make it easier to gauge capital 
flows to the blue economy.

The emergence of blue and 
water labels 
The first water-labelled bond recorded by 
Climate Bonds in 2014 was a EUR500m bond 
that matured in 2019, issued by the NWB 
Bank, which was the only water-labelled 
bond issuer recorded from 2014–2017. NWB 
Bank is a Dutch public bank that funds water 
and municipal authorities. Therefore, water 
bonds are an integral part of its operations, 
with most proceeds dedicated to adaptation 
efforts, such as flood protection, water 
management, and water quality activities. 43  
Its most recent water bond, priced in 2024, 
was a EUR1bn deal maturing in 2031. In 2024, 
it also priced a smaller EUR50m water bond 
maturing in 2051. 
In 2024, Climate Bonds recorded aligned 
blue- or water-labelled debt volume of nearly 
USD5.4bn which represents 83% of the total 
blue or water-labelled debt volume recorded 
in 2023, and an 18% decrease. Despite the 
more recent surge, blue- and water-labelled 
instruments still comprise less than 0.5% of the 
GSS+ debt market, signalling a large amount of 
untapped potential.

Asia-Pacific and Europe 
account for 74% of the market
Asia-Pacific represents 40% of the marketRegional blue landscape
Asia Pacific, with 40% (USD10.5bn) of the 
cumulative volume issued, replaced Europe in 
2024 as the main source of blue- and water-
labelled bonds issued. Europe accounted for 
34% and LAC 22%. Europe and Asia Pacific 
are the regions with the largest shares of 
cumulative GSS+ debt, so their rankings are no 
surprise. In Asia Pacific, the private sector is by 
far the largest source of issuance accounting for 
60% of the blue- or water-labelled debt volume, 
while in Europe government-backed entities 
dominate the market representing 83% of the 
volume, and in LAC non-financial corporates 
account for 65%.
Government-backed  
entities and non-financial 
corporates dominate
The cumulative issuance from government-
backed entities and non-financial corporates 
is USD8.6bn, however the number of deals is 
far greater from non-financial corporations (52 
versus 24). In 2024, non-financial corporations 
and sovereigns were the only issuer types to 
mark an increase in volume. The former, largely 
driven by multiple issues from Companhia 
de Saneamento Básico do Estado de São 
Paulo - Sabesp (4, USD1bn); and the latter, 
solely driven by a sovereign from the Republic 
of Indonesia (USD1bn), marking the second

6. Policy overview
Green defence 
As 2030 approaches, governments increasingly 
need to confront what ‘whole economy 
transition’ means. Decarbonisation efforts 
can no longer be focused on specific sectors 
but need to be embedded across all areas of 
the economy, including those not typically 
associated with environmental action, such as 
health, education, and even the defence sector.  
Decision makers cannot avoid the interaction 
between defence priorities and key climate-
related objectives, for example resilience 
and energy security. Engaging with the 
defence sector is critical, not only to meet 
these objectives but also to ensure its 
decarbonisation. Not engaging runs the risk 
of the sector being excluded from sovereign 
transition planning and absorbing much of 
limited carbon budgets.  
The defence sector accounts for a large share of 
public budgets, emissions, and raw materials 
consumption, which is projected to increase, 
therefore, it has high decarbonisation potential. 
Defence spending equates to 2% of EU GDP , 
3.4% in the USA, and 1.7% in China.44,45 The UK 
recently pledged to reach defence spending 
of 2.5% GDP by 2027, and Japan pledged 
to double spending to 2% GDP by 2027.46,47 
However, defence is not included in national 
carbon budgets or NDCs, despite accounting 
for up to 5.5% of global emissions and large 
proportions of central government emissions 
(50% in the UK).48
Additionally, the sector accounts for a large 
proportion of government procurement. Green 
public procurement across all government 
spending can provide demand certainty to 
green industry which is crucial in more nascent 
industries. Green procurement practices and 
offtake agreements in defence spending can 
stimulate renewable energy, green steel, and 
synthetic fuel production.  
R&D is an important element of defence 
investment, which in the defence sector can 
facilitate the wider transition. For example, 
aviation accounts for a significant portion 
of defence emissions so R&D to develop 
sustainable aviation fuels will also facilitate 
decarbonisation of a major hard-to-abate sector.  
Governments across the world will need to 
ramp up climate resilience investment for 
defence. This not only directly ensures resilience 
of critical defence infrastructure, but also 
broader national and global resilience to reduce 
social unrest, resource scarcity, and migration 
which increase the likelihood of conflicts. 
Recognising the value of climate resilience and 
global mitigation efforts to conflict prevention 
and geopolitical stability, which therefore 
minimises pressures on defence budgets, 
ensures that climate mitigation and resilience 
remain as high priorities.

7. Sector Criteria guide issuers  
to make genuine contribution 
Climate Bonds Standards team 
has been working to update, 
strengthen, and expand the 
Sector Criteria for agriculture 
and food systems
According to the latest IPCC assessment, 
agrifood system emissions from production to 
consumption, represent around 31% of global 
GHG emissions. Although most of the sector’s 
emissions come from agricultural production 
and land use change, a third occurs during the 
post-production stage. Thus, addressing the 
challenges and reducing emissions from this 
critical sector will be essential to reaching the 
global climate goals.
Climate Bonds has worked on updating, 
strengthening, and expanding Agriculture 
Production (Crop and Livestock) Criteria. 
The aim was to offer guidance on the emissions 
reductions required to transition to net-zero 
and sustainable agriculture production and 
keep it aligned with the most up-to-date 
science and technologies. The Criteria propose 
emissions reduction trajectories for the sector, 
expand the scope to Certify not only UoP bonds 
but also sustainability debt instruments and 
entities, and incorporate safeguards for other 
environmental impacts and social aspects. The 
new versions were launched in 2024 and are 
now available for Certification.49
Additionally, as part of the food systems 
work, Climate Bonds launched Alternative 
Proteins Criteria in April 2025 and started the 
development process for the entire Food Value 
Chain Criteria, both of which will be available 
for Certification in 2025.
As the Alternative Proteins sector is growing 
very rapidly it represents an excellent 
opportunity for green investment in projects 
and assets that reduce emissions from 
traditional protein sources, such as livestock. 
The Alternative Proteins Criteria provide the 
first certification scheme focused on sustainable 
protein alternatives, which will facilitate capital 
flows to scale the sector and contribute to the 
transformation of the food industry.
Furthermore, the Food Value Chain Criteria 
will address eight key factors identified 
as emissions drivers across the food value 
chain:
 • Energy use
 • Transport
 • Buildings
 • Cold chain
 • Packaging
 • Food loss and waste
 • Sustainable sourcing
 • Consumption patterns
With these Criteria, Climate Bonds 
demonstrates its commitment to promoting 
science-based standards and alignment with a 
net-zero future by increasing their applicability, 
coverage, and impact in a strategic sector such 
as the agrifood system.
Collaborative projects
New Agrifood Criteria from Climate Bonds 
unlock investment opportunities for 
climate action
Climate Bonds has launched four new sets 
of Agrifood Criteria, developed with support 
from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation 
through The Finance Hub. These science-
backed tools empower investors, industry 
leaders, and policymakers to drive real 
transformation in the agrifood sector.
For the first time, market-ready screening tools 
outline transition pathways to mobilise capital 
for reducing emissions and environmental 
pressures in agriculture while fostering rural 
economic development.
Covering Agriculture Production (Crops 
& Livestock), Alternative Proteins, the 
Food Value Chain, and Deforestation- and 
Conversion-Free Sourcing (DCF), these 
Criteria provide forward-thinking solutions 
tailored to industry needs and clear, expert-
backed actions to align investments with 
critical climate goals.
By sharing these tools, Climate Bonds 
reinforces its commitment to a net-zero  
future and reshaping global food systems  
for sustainability.
Methane Abatement Financial Taskforce
COP28 marked a turning point in the oil 
and gas industry’s commitment to reducing 
methane and flaring emissions. The Oil & Gas 
Decarbonization Charter (OGDC) brought 
together 50 companies, including 29 national 
oil companies (NOCs), in a ground-breaking 
commitment to eliminate methane and flaring 
pollution, which was an unprecedented step 
for a segment that had previously remained 
largely outside global emission reduction 
initiatives. Since then, the OGDC has expanded 
to 54 companies, reinforcing its potential as 
a key driver of industry-led climate action. 
Additionally, the World Bank launched 
the Global Flaring and Methane Reduction 
Partnership’s Trust Fund (GFMR) to provide 
NOCs with technical expertise and seed funding 
for methane and flaring abatement projects, 
further supporting the transition toward lower-
emission oil and gas operations.
Climate Bonds, sponsored by the Global 
Methane Hub (GMH), is leading the Methane 
Abatement Financial Taskforce (MAFT) 
alongside the Environmental Defense Fund 
(EDF), Columbia University, and other partners. 
This initiative aims to develop guidance for 
integrating methane abatement into oil and gas 
debt structuring, exploring how debt capital 
markets can accelerate investment in methane 
mitigation projects. Climate Bonds has played 
a pivotal role in this effort, helping to define 
mitigation activities for investors, and oil and 
gas companies, to structure financing that 
aligns with fiduciary responsibilities and climate 
goals. The forthcoming guidance will provide a 
framework for scaling up methane mitigation 
financing, with a particular focus on NOCs, 
ensuring that capital seekers and providers can 
confidently engage in transactions that drive 
measurable emissions reductions.

8. Climate Bonds supports  
local taxonomy development
Climate Bonds provides expert guidance in 
designing sustainable taxonomies, supporting 
over 30 national and regional governments in 
creating clear definitions and science-based 
criteria for green economic activities aligned 
with national priorities and the Paris Agreement.
As pioneers in the field, Climate Bonds 
launched the first green taxonomy in 2012, 
which became the foundation for voluntary and 
mandatory frameworks worldwide, and the 
new gambit to combat greenwashing.
As a trusted partner, Climate Bonds helps 
countries develop taxonomies that bridge 
the gap between financial markets and 
sustainability goals. This work ensures that 
taxonomies are not just theoretical concepts 
but practical tools that drive real-world impact. 
This involves close collaboration with 
governments, international organisations, 
multilateral development banks, development 
agencies, regulators, and local experts, 
ensuring each taxonomy is tailored to its 
unique context while promoting global 
interoperability. 
For years, Climate Bonds has led the way in 
green taxonomy development, focusing on 
mitigation. Now, this expertise is expanding 
into adaptation and resilience (A&R) to 
accelerate global capital flows into resilience 
investments, both through the 
 innovative Climate Bonds Resilience Taxonomy 
(CBRT) and the development of A&R objectives 
under national taxonomies (e.g., Rwanda, 
Brazil, and Senegal).
In 2024, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, 
Rwanda, Brazil, and the Common Ground 
Taxonomy (CGT) made the most significant 
progress in Climate Bonds’ taxonomy work. 
The key developments in each country are 
summarised below:
Australia
Led by the Australian 
Sustainable Finance Institute 
(ASFI), the Australian 
Taxonomy is a joint industry-
government initiative developed in partnership 
with the Commonwealth Treasury. 
Building its experience with other sustainable 
finance taxonomies globally, Climate Bonds 
has provided technical assistance for the 
development of the taxonomy’s technical 
screening criteria including substantial 
contribution, do no significant harm (DNSH,) 
and minimum social safeguards (MSS) criteria. 
The taxonomy was co-developed with experts 
and stakeholders across the Australian 
financial system in order to design credible, 
usable, and internationally interoperable 
criteria that could also be tailored and 
adapted to the Australian context.  
The initial phase of the taxonomy development 
process that started in July 2023 and ended in 
February 2025 focused on six priority sectors:
 • Electricity generation and supply;
 • Minerals, mining, and metals; 
 • Built environment; 
 • Manufacturing and industry;
 • Transport;
 • Agriculture and forestry.
New Zealand
The Centre for Sustainable 
Finance (Toitū Tahua (CSF)) 
is leading the effort to 
design and develop the first 
phase of the Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) 
Taxonomy with the support of Climate Bonds 
as a technical partner. The work builds on 
the Recommendations Report published 
in July 2024, which provided an initial set 
of recommendations for the design of the 
Taxonomy.50 The report was developed by an 
independent technical advisory group (ITAG) 
convened by the CSF. Climate Bonds served 
as a delivery partner for the project and 
provided technical assistance to the ITAG for 
the formulation of the recommendations based 
on the organisation’s experience with other 
benchmark taxonomies.
Aiming to be interoperable with the Australian 
Taxonomy, the NZ Taxonomy is initially focusing 
on the design of technical screening criteria 
for the agriculture and forestry sectors. It will 
address two environmental objectives, namely 
climate mitigation and climate A&R. In addition, 
it will also cover DNSH and MSS criteria. 
Furthermore, the Taxonomy will integrate the 
knowledge and rights of iwi/Māori groups as a 
transversal theme across the entire Taxonomy, 
highlighting the leadership of Aotearoa New 
Zealand in recognising the contribution 
and rights of indigenous peoples and local 
communities as custodians of biodiversity, and 
as partners in its conservation, restoration, and 
sustainable land use.
Thailand
In 2024, the development 
of phase II of the Thailand 
Taxonomy was initiated, 
continuing work on phase 
I, which was finalised in 2023. Climate 
Bonds was selected by the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) and the 
Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) in an open competition 
as the main technical contractor for both 
phases, and 2024 brought sectors such as 
industry, agriculture, and construction to 
the Thailand Taxonomy. The second phase 
of development continues to utilise the 
innovative ‘traffic lights’ scheme to create 
not only a green label but also a transition 
label to facilitate economic transformation 
and attract investor funds to hard-to-abate 
sectors. In phase II, Thailand’s taxonomy has 
received several innovative elements. It is the 
first taxonomy having sustainable aquaculture 
practices and the first one having generic 
criteria and thresholds that allow industries not 
traditionally covered by this type of document 
(e.g., light manufacturing industries that are 
not significant sources of emission) to benefit 
from the taxonomy. Phase I of the taxonomy 
was also updated to include the production of 
sustainable aviation fuels.
Rwanda
The second phase of the 
Rwanda Taxonomy was 
initiated and largely finalised 
in 2024, a continuation of the 
first phase initiated and finalised in 2023 and 
presented at COP28. During the second phase, 
sectors such as industry, waste management, 
water, and information and communications 
technology (ICT) were added. The Climate 
Bonds team also developed roadmaps to 
integrate the Taxonomy into green budget 
tagging and lending policies for local 
development institutions.
An innovative mechanism for assessing the 
substantial contribution of activity to A&R has 
been integrated into the Rwanda Taxonomy 
2024 for the first time. It was based on the CBRT 
published in mid-2024, the first such detailed 
document of its kind for labelling adaptation 
investments. The methodology mechanism is 
based on the use of 1,500 metrics distributed 
among thematic clusters (building, energy, 
ecosystems, etc.) and linked to the specific 
natural hazards to which the Taxonomy user 
wants to build resilience.

Brazil
The first phase of the  
Brazilian Sustainable 
Taxonomy (BST) is an initiative 
led by the Brazilian Ministry of 
Finance and supported by GIZ and the United 
Nations Environment Programme Finance 
Initiative (UNEP FI). On the environmental 
front, Climate Bonds and its long-term 
partner Ambire Global are providing technical 
consultancy for the development of the criteria 
for the objectives of climate change mitigation, 
adaptation to climate change, and the 
conservation, sustainable management, and 
use of soil and forests.
The BST is structured around priority sectors 
that are crucial to Brazil’s environmental 
and socio-economic landscape, selected on 
their potential to substantially contribute 
to environmental objectives, economic and 
social relevance, and interoperability with 
existing international taxonomies. In 2024, 
the focus was on identifying key economic 
activities through a robust quantitative 
and qualitative approach, and developing 
technical screening criteria to guide 
sustainable investments. These criteria are 
currently undergoing a two-phased public 
consultation process to ensure transparency 
and stakeholder engagement. The final 
publication of the BST is expected in the 
second half of 2025, representing a major step 
forward in Brazil’s sustainable finance agenda.
CGT 51
In November 2024, the International Platform 
on Sustainable Finance (IPSF) presented the 
Multi-Jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy 
(M-CGT), a comparison of the sustainable 
finance taxonomies of China, the EU, and 
Singapore. The scope of M-CGT builds on 
the bilateral EU-China CGT , covering green 
activities and their corresponding substantial 
contribution criteria that meet the climate 
change mitigation objective. The M-CGT 
analysed and mapped a total of 110 activities 
across eight focus sectors, supported by 
Climate Bonds.
The M-CGT serves as a technical reference 
document for a wide range of market 
participants including financial institutions, 
corporates, investors, and external reviewers. 
It allows them to assess what could be 
considered green across the three jurisdictions 
in scope, based on the activities, environmental 
objectives, and criteria covered in the M-CGT . 
The M-CGT will also serve as a reference for 
jurisdictions that are developing their domestic 
green taxonomies and has been designed 
to accommodate the comparison of more 
jurisdictional taxonomies in the future. This will 
increase the number of taxonomies that are 
interoperable and help facilitate cross-border 
green capital flows.
Projects in Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Hong 
Kong, Peru, and Senegal have also launched in 
2024, with publications anticipated in 2025.

9. Certification at Climate Bonds  
reinforces rigour 
The Climate Bonds Standard 
and Certification Scheme 
experienced robust growth 
of 42% in 2024, as Certified 
volume rose to USD31.1bn 
compared to USD21.9bn the 
prior year. Cumulative Certified issuance to 
the end of 2024 amounted to USD298.7bn, just 
short of 10% of cumulative aligned green bond 
volume to date. 
The Certification of Japan’s two-tranche  
GX transition bond (JPY1.6tn, USD11bn) in  
early 2024 was the largest Certification against 
the Climate Bonds Standard to date. The 
deal was a major milestone in sovereign-led 
transition finance, supporting advanced 
sustainable technologies and early-stage 
research and development.52 
Other notable firsts in 2024 included the 
Certification of the first Indian municipality 
bond. Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s 
INR1bn (USD12m), 5-year bond will finance 
investments in water, waste management, 
and flood resilience projects. Bloomberg data 
records 47 local and regional government bond 
issuers from India at the end of 2024, with 
combined outstanding volume of USD900bn. 
This level of autonomous funding offers a huge 
opportunity for Indian municipality issuers to 
leverage the green bond market to support a 
pipeline of green mitigation, and adaptation 
and resilience (A&R) expenditures.53
Climate Bonds Certified deals originating from 
Australia reached an all-time high, totalling 
USD6.7bn or a 41% of aligned green volume, 
reinforcing Climate Bonds’ important role in 
the rapid growth of the Australian sustainable 
finance market.  Annual aligned green volume 
from Australia grew by 83% in 2024 reaching 
USD16bn compared to USD8.8bn in 2023.  
Among the issuers obtaining Climate Bonds 
Certification was Firstmac, Australia’s largest 
non-bank lending company to either owner 
occupiers, or landlords for residential property. 
The privately owned entity priced a pair of long 
dated residential mortgage-backed securities 
(RMBS), Certified against Climate Bonds 
Low-Carbon Buildings Criteria. The AUD306M 
(USD203.5m) 2055 deal was priced in June, 
followed by the AUD240m (USD156.2m) 2056 
in November. The proceeds of both deals were 
earmarked to finance or refinance buildings 
with rooftop solar installations.  
In June 2024, South Australia’s main electricity 
distributor, South Australian Power Network 
(SAPN) priced a 3- and 8.5-year dual tranche 
deal with combined volume of AUD495m 
(USD330m). The deal was Certified against 
Climate Bonds Electric Grids and Storage 
Criteria with proceeds earmarked to support 
SAPN’s transition to a distributed and 
decarbonised energy system, and adaptation 
and resilience projects, such as network 
bushfire readiness to maintain and enhance 
grid resilience and reliability.  
Climate Bonds Standard V4.2 reinforced the 
rigour and expanded the scope of Certification to 
planned assets and assets under development.54 
The new DCF Entity Certification label was 
also introduced in 2024, enabling Agrifood 
entities to showcase their deforestation and 
conversion-free supply chains. 
Looking ahead to 2025, the Climate Bonds 
Standard and Certification Scheme is set to 
evolve further, integrating resilience criteria 
to address climate adaptation and strengthen 
market frameworks. Climate Bonds is working 
with interested parties in obtaining the 
Entity Certification label, setting a precedent 
for company-level alignment with net-zero 
pathways. Climate Bonds is also focused on 
applying its Sector Criteria in hard-to-abate 
sectors, supporting the decarbonisation of 
critical industries such as cement and steel. 
The revamped Climate Bonds Agriculture 
Production Criteria launched in 2024, 
introduced innovative science-based transition 
pathways for several important commodities. 
These developments reaffirm Climate Bonds’ 
commitment to driving robust standards and 
mobilising finance at the scale required for 
climate action.

10. Capacity building and technical assistance 
offers guidance and customised solutions 
The Capacity Building and Technical Assistance 
(CBTA) team offers expert guidance on GSS+ 
bond issuance, transition planning, and 
sustainable finance lending criteria. CBTA take 
a science-based approach, aligning with a 
1.5°C pathway, ensuring best practices while 
customising solutions to fit the unique needs 
of each market and region. With Climate 
Bonds’ extensive global network and deep 
understanding of diverse policy and regulatory 
landscapes, CBTA deliver tailored, high-impact 
support for every client. Below is a brief 
overview of the comprehensive scope of CBTA’s 
work in 2024: 
Case study 1: Development of 
an e-learning course 
The project achieved 
significant success in advancing 
subnational sustainable 
finance, with key outcomes 
including the successful 
delivery of thematic workshops, webinars, 
and development of e-learning courses. These 
initiatives have made substantial contributions 
to building capacity among stakeholders, 
particularly in the areas of sustainable finance, 
nature-based solutions (NbS), and ESG risk 
management. Below are some of the key 
successes that highlight the overall impact of 
the project. 
Successful stakeholder engagement and 
knowledge transfer 
One of the greatest successes of the project 
was its ability to engage a diverse and wide-
ranging group of stakeholders. A total of 264 
participants attended the thematic workshops, 
which were held across four countries, while 
482 participants attended the webinars. 
This level of participation highlights the 
project’s ability to attract the right audience, 
including public officials, project developers, 
and financial sector representatives, all of 
whom play a crucial role in driving climate-
resilient investments at the subnational level. 
These workshops and webinars provided 
practical insights, case studies, and actionable 
knowledge that stakeholders can apply in their 
day-to-day work, greatly enhancing their ability 
to integrate NbS into investment projects and 
adopt sustainable financial practices. 
High-quality, relevant content, and 
practical applications 
The project’s ability to deliver high-quality, 
relevant content was also a major success. 
Participants consistently highlighted the 
practical nature of the materials, the value of 
real-world case studies, and the application of 
financing mechanisms that could be directly 
integrated into their work. The inclusion 
of sector-specific strategies, such as those 
tailored to regenerative agriculture, further 
added value and demonstrated the project’s 
commitment to addressing the diverse needs of 
the stakeholders involved. 
Commitment to long-term  
capacity building 
A key achievement was the project’s focus 
on building long-term capacity, rather than 
merely offering one-time training. The 
sustained engagement through workshops, 
webinars, and e-learning courses contributed 
to a continuous learning process. This 
demonstrates the project’s impact not only in 
terms of immediate knowledge transfer but 
also in fostering an environment of ongoing 
professional development in the field of 
sustainable finance. 
Case study 2: Transition  
plan assessments  
Climate transition 
plans are vital tools for 
companies to demonstrate 
their commitment to a 
1.5°C-aligned, net-zero 
economy. Given the urgency to 
reverse rising greenhouse gas emissions, many 
companies are re-imagining their operations 
in the context of a net-zero future. As more 
companies seek guidance on this critical 
transformation, Climate Bonds’ expertise on 
the topic is increasingly sought after. Climate 
Bonds’ collaborative cross-team approach 
which includes research, taxonomy, and policy 
expertise, provides organisations with a clear, 
actionable roadmap for what a credible and 
ambitious transition plan should look like. 
From corporates to financial institutions, 
CBTA has collaborated on navigating the 
complexities of decarbonisation across supply 
chains and all emission scopes. Some of the 
most challenging sectors have been tackled, 
including steel, cement, chemicals, energy 
industries, and agriculture, leading the way in 
transforming hard-to-abate industries toward 
a sustainable future. Below is an example of 
the methodology employed in a project where 
CBTA supported transition.  
Gap assessment of existing sustainable 
finance offerings  
As part of this successful project, sustainable 
lending criteria were developed that empowered 
financial institutions to elevate their climate 
ambitions, starting with assessing each 
institution’s current sustainable finance offerings 
and evaluating their engagement with transition 
efforts. Where gaps were identified, tailored 
solutions were designed, ensuring Climate 
Bonds’ support was customised to meet the 
unique needs and business activities of each 
institution. The approach involved closing 
these gaps by benchmarking against Climate 
Bonds’ science-based Criteria, motivating 
financial institutions to set more ambitious 
targets, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors, 
and align their strategies with climate goals.  
Establish milestones and KPIs for corporate 
transition planning for SMEs that make up 
the supply chain of global brands
Through the successful implementation of 
Climate Bonds’ science-based, 1.5°C aligned 
Criteria, CBTA supported small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) in selecting material key 
performance indicators (KPIs) and targets that 
comprehensively addressed emissions scopes 
1, 2, and 3, both in the short, medium, and long 
term. A critical aspect of the approach was 
integrating regional nuances and understanding 
the diverse needs of investors, which allowed 
CBTA to craft transition plans that significantly 
enhanced SME access to sustainable bank 
financing. This work helped the clients gain a 
competitive edge by aligning their operations 
with climate elements, while positioning them 
to attract greater global brand interest and 
financing opportunities. 
Mapping the role and impact of the 
carbon market on driving transition  
Given that many organisations are citing the use 
of carbon markets to drive transition, the CBTA 
team performed an analysis of its effectiveness. 
One of the research papers analysed how carbon 
markets can be used to provide a funding source 
for decarbonisation activities to spur innovative 
energy transition solutions and the risks 
associated with doing so.

11. Climate Bonds teams around the world
Climate Bond’s work involves many teams 
around the world who are collectively 
focused on identifying opportunities, 
addressing difficulties and concerns, 
and finding solutions with one collective 
ambition: to mobilise global capital for 
climate action.  
The main body of this report has relied upon 
the data collected by the Market Intelligence 
Data team which is then analysed by the 
Market Research team to identify market 
developments and trends. In addition to 
offering an in-depth analysis of the GSS+ 
market landscape, trends, and outlook, this 
report has highlighted the work done by the 
Standards, Taxonomy, Certification, and CBTA 
teams. This section provides a brief overview 
of the work undertaken by many of the other 
teams at Climate Bonds. 
Market Research Team 
The Climate Bonds Market Research team 
produces standalone reports while also 
supporting a wide range of varied projects 
which endeavour to serve Climate Bonds 
ambition, collaborating with partners both 
internally and externally. The Market Research 
team translates Climate Bonds definitional 
work into solutions for issuers, investors, and 
policy makers.
The Climate Bonds Sustainable Debt Summary 
and Global State of the Market research report 
series, which includes both global and region/
country specific reports, describe the shape 
and size of the investible opportunity set. This 
data illustrates to asset owners and asset 
managers that there are investable climate, 
social, and sustainable opportunities, which 
they can allocate capital to.55
Additionally, the Market Research team 
conducts market, sector, country, and product 
analysis to inform standalone and collaborative 
reports. More recently the team has assessed 
transition plans for priority decarbonisation 
sectors and financial institutions against 
proprietary frameworks, to support investors in 
designing their own frameworks for identifying 
and evaluating transition investments, examine 
the quality of post-issuance reporting and 
make recommendations for improvements.
Market Intelligence Data Team 
2024 highlights:
The Market Intelligence Data team had another 
busy year screening labelled issuance from 
around the globe. The total number of bonds 
screened increased YOY by 25% with green 
increasing by 4%, S&S by 44%, and SLBs 
declining by 9%. The screened data creates the 
three data products that are part of the Market 
Intelligence Data Subscription Service which 
are delivered to clients monthly. The data 
team supply asset managers, index providers, 
issuers, NGOs, and academics with the data 
to meet their various use cases such as index 
eligibility, portfolio profiling, and research. In 
addition to regular screening activities, the 
team also released the updated green bond 
methodology which improved interoperability 
with the market, especially for the cement, 
steel, and blue economy sectors. 
Outlook for 2025:
Following on from the release of the updated 
green bond methodology, 2025 has already 
seen the release of the new S&S methodology 
(detailed on page 16), with enhanced criteria

for the assessment of UoP in S&S, as well 
as integration of criteria around affordable 
housing, in addition to environmental and 
social resilience. A new version of the SLB 
methodology is anticipated, which will review 
the current alignment rationale where required. 
Thought Leadership
Climate Bonds expands its guidance on 
credible transition plans
Following the earlier publication of a checklist 
for credible corporate transition plans, 
Climate Bonds is shortly to release best 
practice guidance on bank transition plans, 
and on sovereign transition plans.56 Transition 
plans are set to become a key source of 
information for investors and lenders seeking 
to finance the transition to a low-carbon, 
climate-resilient economy, whether through 
labelled instruments such as SLBs or SLLs, 
general purpose debt including corporate 
and sovereign lending, or equity. Transition 
planning processes can also help increase 
national climate ambition. Investment planning 
that prioritises private finance mobilisation 
can reveal greater capacity for climate action, 
allowing more ambitious target setting. 
This work builds on existing guidance and 
assessment frameworks, as Climate Bonds 
seeks to promote consistency in market 
definitions, guidance, and standards.
Policy 
Policy at Climate Bonds is managed by the Global 
Policy Team (GPT) and the EU Policy Team, both 
of which work collaboratively internally and 
externally to maximise Climate Bonds’ impact 
and influence on the policy landscape. 
Global Policy Team 
The GPT supports policymakers globally 
with the objective of accelerating sustainable 
investment and capital market flows into GSS+ 
bond markets. Climate Bonds works at all 
policymaking levels from international to local 
endeavouring to tilt global financial systems to 
deliver climate action.
Hard-to-abate transition on the global agenda
In 2024, the G20 sustainable finance working 
group specifically focused on the transition of 
hard-to-abate sectors. Climate Bonds’ input 
paper The role of policymakers in mobilising 
private finance to ensure a credible and just 
transition in steel and cement highlighted 
this decade as the best chance for a stable 
transition in these sectors.57
There is increasing recognition of the role of 
development finance institutions (DFIs) in 
mobilising private capital. Climate Bonds’ 
policy paper The Role of DFIs in Accelerating 
the Mobilisation of Green Capital sets out 
key recommendations for European DFIs, 
shareholders, and the European Commission, 
which can unlock greater mobilisation 
potential to deliver climate impacts.58 The GPT 
are now actively working with development 
banks to help them to develop tailored de-
risking policies. 
However, public sector risk-sharing is limited. 
Policymakers and investors will need to 
identify innovative ways to de-risk key climate 
investments. As seen at COP29, the insurance 
sector is increasingly being called on to fulfil 
this role and de-risk climate resilience and 
transition investments.59  
The EU Policy Team  
The EU team provides thought leadership, 
research, and advocacy on sustainable finance 
regulations, including the EU Taxonomy, EU 
green bond standards, and transition finance. 
Through partnerships and stakeholder 
engagement, the team supports the 
development of credible, science-based criteria 
to ensure investments drive meaningful climate 
action.
The EU team is actively building networks in 
Brussels and with key institutions, launching 
its first Climate Bonds Connect event at the 
European Parliament in 2024, with the support 
of 30% of the European political parties. 
Climate Bonds’ work is gaining EU-level 
recognition, and in 2024, its 20 Policy Levers 
for Decarbonising Buildings in Europe report 
was the first Climate Bonds publication to 
feature on the European Commission’s BuildUP 
portal.60
In an evolving EU political landscape, Climate 
Bonds is refining its positioning and messaging 
to push for stronger climate action, including 
ensuring fossil fuel companies take methane 
abatement seriously. The team produces 
positions on EU legislative files such as the 
Omnibus proposal, competitiveness compass, 
and Clean Industrial Deal.
China Team 
2024 Highlights
In 2024, Climate Bonds China continued 
to support the development of a robust 
transition finance taxonomy at both national 
and subnational levels in China. Climate 
Bonds produced research reports analysing 
the transition investment landscape and 
identifying implementation challenges in 
key sectors such as steel, power, and the 
agricultural-food system. In collaboration 
with the Climate Bonds policy and market 
research teams via targeted market briefings 
and engagement, Climate Bonds endeavours to 
foster high-quality GSS+ market development 
in Greater China, ensuring that its practices 
align more closely with international 
standards.61,62
2025 Outlook 
In 2025, the China team will support the further 
development of incentive structures for China’s 
green and transition finance market. Climate 
Bonds China plans to launch an initiative 
focused on A&R finance, with comprehensive 
research into the necessary policy frameworks, 
incentive structures, and the continued 
development of related taxonomies. The China 
team will continue to promote innovative 
actions and financial instruments to catalyse 
decarbonisation financing in high-emitting 
sectors, which will involve research into the 
power market and coal transition mechanisms, 
both in China and emerging economies. 
India Team 
Climate Bonds in South Asia engages with 
policymakers, regulators, financial institutions, 
businesses, and investors to advance 
sustainable finance and manage climate risks. 
In India, the team’s work, while primarily 
focused on India, also expands to other 
countries in the region, promoting credible 
transition planning and climate risk analysis, 
encouraging capacity building, and supporting 
the development of policies and taxonomies to 
ensure market integrity through Certification.
Climate Bonds aims to drive financial flows by 
fostering investor engagement and creating 
narratives that build consensus toward a 
resilient and sustainable finance market in 
India. The India team’s efforts also focus on 
enhancing knowledge and understanding, and 
awareness of green, transition, and resilience 
(GTR) concepts, together with the associated 
GSS+ instruments, among key stakeholders 
including financial institutions, corporates, and 
pension and insurance funds.

From a policy perspective, Climate Bonds 
is working with regulators on climate risk 
and transition, and other topics such as 
proposing mandatory carve-outs, fiscal 
incentives, guarantees, and mechanisms 
such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
into sustainable finance frameworks. Climate 
Bonds involvement includes contributing to 
the technical committee on climate finance 
taxonomy, ensuring that taxonomies reflect 
emerging best practices and support the 
development of a credible and harmonised 
sustainable finance market. Additionally, 
Climate Bonds is in the process of establishing 
a resilience programme to further strengthen 
the market’s capacity to address climate-
related risks and opportunities.
The India team’s engagement spans national, 
sub-national, and international levels, including 
participation in multi-stakeholder assemblies 
such as the G20 and COP . Climate Bonds’ 
leadership in India is reflected by its presence 
on influential policy committees on climate risk 
and finance, including those under IFSCA, Niti 
Aayog, and the Ministry of Finance; ensuring its 
work continues to shape the broader sustainable 
finance agenda in the region.
Japan Team 
2024 Highlights
In 2024, the Japan team made significant 
strides in advancing credible transition finance 
and shaping national policy discussion. 
Policy influence and GX Bond Certification: 
Climate Bonds guidelines were referenced by 
METI in official documents, and Climate Bonds 
CEO Sean Kidney was appointed as an advisor 
to the GX Acceleration Agency. Climate Bonds 
provided technical input to METI, MOF, and 
MOE on the GX Strategy for energy transition 
and transition finance. Climate Bonds 
Certified Japan’s first climate transition bond, 
positioning Japan’s sovereign issuance within 
international best practices and excluding LNG 
and operational use of ammonia co-firing from 
UoP .63,64
Corporate Transition Guidance: The Japan 
team developed the Transition Strategy Toolkit 
with IGES and hosted a high-impact webinar 
with participants across finance, corporate, and 
consulting sectors.65 
Investor Engagement: The Japan team held 
bilateral dialogues and various roundtables 
with asset managers (e.g., GPIF, Nippon Life, 
Dai-ichi Life) and co-hosted sessions with 
AIGCC and PRI to drive credible transition 
assessments.66
Municipality collaboration: Climate Bonds 
published a Joint Statement with the Hokkaido 
Government and the City of Sapporo, which 
aims to promote Green Transformation (GX) and 
the Asset Management Special Zone in Hokkaido 
with Regional Revitalisation in Hokkaido.67  
Outlook for 2025 
In 2025, Climate Bonds Japan will focus on 
driving systemic change toward a credible 
and ambitious 1.5°C-aligned transition, with 
particular emphasis on reducing LNG reliance 
to ensure energy security, accelerating 
decarbonisation in the energy sector, and 
promoting methane reduction. 
Climate Bonds Japan’s work will centre around 
four key areas. 
 • Policy engagement: Advocating for the 
removal of LNG from government policies 
and support schemes, and promoting the 
adoption of transition finance policies that 
align with international standards. Through 
close engagement with METI, MOF, MOE, 
and GX Acceleration Agency, Climate Bonds 
aims to influence Japan’s policies and key 
regulatory frameworks. 
 • Investor mobilisation: Climate Bonds 
will strengthen the capacity of Japanese 
investors, including banks, asset owners, 
and asset managers, to integrate transition 
assessments and decarbonisation targets 
into their investment strategies. 
 • Corporate transition: Climate Bonds 
will work directly with high-emission 
corporations, particularly in the electric 
utilities and gas sectors, to support the 
development of credible, science-aligned 
transition plans.  
 • Local government collaboration: Climate 
Bonds Japan team will continue engagement 
with local governments to support the 
scaling of revitalisation through renewable 
energy, regional energy efficiency, and green 
investment pipelines, ensuring alignment 
with international standards and attracting 
both domestic and international capital. 
Latin America and the 
Caribbean Team 
2024 Highlights
G20 Engagement: Climate Bonds, as a 
knowledge partner for the Brazilian G20 
presidency, contributed with an input paper 
emphasising the crucial role of policymakers 
in mobilising private finance to support a 
credible and just transition in the steel and 
cement sectors. Presented during the third 
meeting of the Sustainable Finance Working 
Group (SFWG) in Belém, the paper served as 
a key reference being cited in the 2024 G20 
Sustainable Finance Report. 
Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Stock 
Exchange network: Last year Climate Bonds 
forged a partnership with 10 stock exchanges 
in LAC, which are highly relevant for the 
development of the sustainable market in the 
region. Through the signature of agreements, 
stock exchanges have committed to collaborate 
with Climate Bonds to promote and reinforce 
their sustainable market. 
Adoption and implementation of the 
Colombian Green Taxonomy (TVC): Climate 
Bonds successfully advanced the adoption and 
implementation of the TVC within Colombia’s 
financial and real economy sectors by building 
capacity through 38 training sessions that 
engaged 2,700 participants, and by developing 
33 tailored tools to support key actors 
throughout the implementation process. 
Through the technical assistance processes, 
COP334.7bn was mobilised toward green 
and sustainable projects. This achievement 
marks a significant milestone in strengthening 
sustainable finance practices and the greening 
of the financial system in Colombia.
Outlook for 2025
The LAC region will play a pivotal role in 
sustainable finance, particularly as it prepares to 
host COP30 in the Brazilian Amazon. Additionally, 
emerging markets such as Chile, Peru, and Brazil 
will introduce their local green and sustainable 
taxonomies, while others like Panama, Costa 
Rica, and the Dominican Republic will advance 
in their taxonomy implementation.
Building on this momentum, the LAC team will 
continue to expand its presence and support 
in the region, strengthening its role in the 
development of sustainable finance frameworks. 
By fostering collaboration, driving innovation, 
and engaging with key stakeholders, the team 
will be well-positioned to contribute to the 
region’s growing sustainable finance ecosystem 
in 2025 and beyond.

Collaboration at Climate Bonds
Collaboration lies at the heart of Climate 
Bonds’ ethos, which can take the form of 
internal collaboration across teams and/or 
working with external partners. The Mobilizing 
sustainable finance for methane abatement 
programme, funded by the Global Methane 
Hub, is a great example of Climate Bonds’ 
collaborative initiatives. The two-year project, 
with a global reach which involves almost 
every team across Climate Bonds, also involves 
partnerships with a multitude of external 
experts in the field; the Climate Policy Initiative 
being one of the key partners in this work.
The project goal is a reduction in methane 
emissions and increased methane abatement 
finance in line with 1.5-degree scenarios 
through facilitating finance flows to activities 
and entities that are cutting methane emissions 
in key sectors, including fossil fuel energy, 
agriculture, and waste.
Climate Bonds aims to promote thought 
leadership via advisory groups and events e.g., 
webinars, conferences, and lunch and learn 
sessions, which have been scheduled to take 
place over the duration of the project.
Stakeholder engagement activities have 
been, and will continue to be, held over 
the course of the project. Events that have 
already taken place to date include COP side 
events (November 2024), Verifiers Assurance 
Roundtable (November 2024), and the China 
Sustainable Investment Forum seminar 
(December 2024).
As the first year of the project draws to a close, 
several reports are due to be published. Those 
that have been published from teams across 
Climate Bonds involve thought leadership, 
policy, market research, standards, taxonomy, 
and many of the regional teams. Subject 
matter and details of reports published to-
date include:
Transition Finance Framework & Assessment 
Guidance Developed. Climate Bonds 
published a report on lessons learned from 
bank disclosures (January 2025), which is 
a stocktake on the state of bank net-zero 
disclosures, highlighting best practices and 
areas for improvement. 68
Policy Research. Three Opportunities in 
Japan for 2025 gave a new year’s reflection on 
green transformation where Climate Bonds 
issued a joint statement with Sapporo City 
and Hokkaido on GX promotion and regional 
revitalization.69 
Benchmarking methane in transition plans: 
Published the Transparency & Reporting in the 
GSS Bond Market which is a comprehensive 
study of post-issuance reporting in the GSS 
bond market, aimed at enabling a healthy and 
transparent market.70
Climate Bonds values such an opportunity to 
investigate, research, reporting, and influence 
the relatively unexplored, yet critical, area of 
methane abatement. As work continues in this 
field, further publications and related events 
will be forthcoming.

12. Outlook 
Aligned GSS+ volume had 
reached USD5.7tn by the end 
of 2024 and was anticipated 
to break through the USD6tn 
mark by mid 2025. That said, 
there is still enormous untapped potential for 
this market, with aligned cumulative figures 
representing just 4% of a growing global debt 
market as of year-end 2024, and supply and 
demand imbalances persisting in the primary 
markets.71 The gap between the USD6.9tn 
issued at year-end 2024 and the USD5.7tn 
meeting the requirements of Climate Bonds 
Dataset Methodologies suggests there is an 
opportunity for issuers to be more ambitious 
and embrace greater rigour in their planning 
and disclosure.
The green bond market continues to thrive with 
labels such as blue and transition continuing 
to develop and adding to the diversity of the 
investible opportunity set. The leadership being 
shown by sovereign issuers through new and 
repeat issuance is guiding the growth of GSS+ 
markets around the globe raising the profile 
of decarbonisation plans and encouraging 
crowding in from the private sector. 
Around half of all debt issuing nations have 
now mobilised the GSS+ market which suggests 
that governments are prioritising expenditures 
with green and social purpose. Social and 
sustainability labels have been used to support 
inclusive, sustainable growth contributing to a 
just transition, and the success of these labels 
in EM demonstrates the influence that policy 
support can have on market growth. Climate 
Bonds expects the following themes to shape 
and drive the GSS+ market in 2025:
1. Government defence 
spending and energy security. 
As noted in the policy section 
while not a new theme as such 
Climate Bonds believes that, 
partially driven by the on-going unpredictable 
political landscape, there will be a continued 
focus on defence sector spending and shoring 
up national energy security.72,73 As the majority 
of national budgets are stretched, funding for 
both of these areas could lead to an increased 
supply of related GSS+ bonds.
2. (Re-) Issuance triggered by 
a steep maturity schedule.  
The GSS+ bond market is 
reaching a coming-of-age 
moment which means that 
many of the GSS+ bonds 
issued in past years are scheduled to mature. 
All the GSS+ labels face a significant upcoming 
maturity profile between 2025–2030, the 
percentage of each label due to expire is 
between 40-48% (Green 40%, Social 48%, 
Sustainability 47%, SLB 43%) together 
amounting to 43% of the total aligned GSS+ 
market outstanding at the end of 2024. By 
country over the next three years China, South 
Korea, and France are scheduled to have the 
largest amounts of aligned GSS+ debt mature. 
By issuer type development banks, financial 
corporates, and government-backed entities 
are those that account for the largest shares 
of the upcoming maturity schedule, and they 
have also been the most prolific issuer type 
by volume and deal count which bodes well 
for the potential issue profile. Auspiciously, 
the experience of issuers attests to the 
authenticity of the market, given that many 
will have returned to it in the interim, and will 
continue to depend on it to refinance with 
like-for-like instruments as with other fixed 
income markets.
3. Transition finance 
framework assessment and 
validation. Climate Bonds is 
participating in, contributing 
to, and supporting the 
development of an increasing number 
of financial institution transition-finance 
framework assessments. Climate Bonds is 
responding to a rising demand for external 
validation of transition-finance frameworks 
across the financial market spectrum. Market 
participants endeavour to enhance the 
credibility of their investment decision-making 
process by collaborating with external and 
independent partners to seek their expertise in 
the field.
4. Sustainability-linked 
bonds can be scaled. While 
SLBs are by far the smallest 
segment of the GSS+ market 
they continue to show potential 
for scale. More issuers are 
endeavouring to uplift the quality of the market 
by referencing credible transition plans in their 
selection of KPIs and SPTs, with the support 
and guidance of Climate Bonds and others. 
Sovereign SLB issuance could be a catalyst for 
growth in this market, as with other GSS labels, 
which is given impetus by the recent SLB issue 
from the Thai government and the planned SLB 
sovereign issue from Slovenia.74
5. A&R being further 
integrated into the 
sustainable debt market. 
The damaging effects of 
global warming are being 
felt with growing frequency 
and severity, which according to the IPCC 
affects approximately 3.3-3.6 billion people 
living in areas highly vulnerable to climate 
change. Major investment is required to build 
resilience against climate-related impacts, yet 
there is a substantial gap in A&R financing. 
Private capital has a vital role to play, with the 
sustainable debt market offering a significant 
opportunity to bridge the A&R financing gap. 
To this end, the Climate Bonds Resilience 
Taxonomy (CBRT) was published in 2024, 
which aims to enable a convergence between 
the social and green themes, promoting the 
eligibility of many social expenditures for larger 
green programmes of issuers to support further 
growth in the GSS+ market. 75

Appendix 
Scope of analysis 
This report includes four sustainable debt 
themes based on the projects, activities, 
and expenditures financed: green, social, 
sustainability, and SLB. The GSS+ themes can 
be described as follows: 
Green: dedicated environmental benefits 
(captured since 2012). 
Social: dedicated social benefits  
(captured since 2020). 
Sustainability: green and social  
benefits combined into one instrument 
(captured since 2020). 
SLB: changes in coupon (almost always 
step-ups) linked the fulfilment of key 
performance indicators (KPIs) against entity 
level sustainability performance targets (SPTs) 
(captured since 2021). 
Transition bonds
Historically, Climate Bonds 
recorded but did not screen 
bonds bearing the transition 
label. As of January 2024, 
Climate Bonds stopped reporting transition 
bonds as a separate category but regards them 
as a sub-set of the green label. Climate Bonds 
now adds such bonds to the Climate Bonds 
Green Bond Dataset, and screens them against 
its Green Bond Dataset Methodology.76
Methodology overview 
This report draws on three Climate  
Bonds datasets: 
1. Green Bond Dataset (GBD) 
2. Social and Sustainability Bond Dataset (SSBD) 
3. SLB Dataset (SLBD)
Bonds meeting the requirements outlined in 
Climate Bonds’ screening methodology qualify 
for inclusion in the datasets and are classified 
as aligned. Labelled bonds for which there is 
not enough information to determine eligibility 
for dataset inclusion are classified as pending 
until sufficient disclosure is available to decide. 
Bonds failing to meet the requirements of 
Climate Bonds’ screening methodology are 
classified as non-aligned and are excluded from 
the datasets.
Green, social, and sustainability bonds 
captured by Climate Bonds meeting the 
requirements outlined in its screening 
methodology qualify for inclusion in the 
datasets and are classified as aligned. 
Labelled bonds for which there is not enough 
information to determine eligibility for dataset 
inclusion are classified as pending until 
sufficient disclosure is available to decide. 
Bonds failing to meet the requirements of 
Climate Bonds’ screening methodology are 
classified as non-aligned and are excluded 
from the datasets.
SLBs are assessed according to Climate 
Bonds Sustainability-Linked Bond Dataset 
Methodology (SLBD Methodology) and classified 
according to four levels of alignment.77 
1. Fully aligned: SLB targets cover all material 
sources of emissions and are aligned with the 
relevant pathway.
Green, social, and sustainability bonds Aligned Pending Excluded
Cumulative USD billion  
as of 31 December 2024
5.7tn 26.1bn 1.2tn
SLBs Fully aligned Strongly aligned Aligning Not aligned
Cumulative USD billion 
as of 31 December 2024
49.1bn 2.5bn 4.7bn 275.5bn
2. Strongly aligned: SLB targets cover all 
material sources of emissions and will be 
aligned with the relevant pathway by 2030. 
3. Aligning: SLB targets cover all material 
sources of emissions, are aligned with the 
pathway on a % reduction basis, and the issuer 
has the basic tenets of a transition plan. 
4. Not aligned: SLB targets fail to meet any of 
the above criteria, or do not meet the other 
requirements detailed in the SLBD Methodology.
As Criteria are developed, Climate Bonds will 
update its GBD methodology and then begin 
screening bonds from issuers in those sectors 
for inclusion, whether labelled as transition 
or as green. The Climate Bonds Taxonomy 
defines the assets and activities that are 
aligned with a 1.5-degree pathway, accepting 
financing with either label.

24. Compared to other reasons, lacking GHG targets is less a ‘fault’ 
of issuers than a current limitation of the SLBDB Methodology, 
which currently only screens bonds from the perspective of climate 
mitigation. On the other hand, climate impacts are material for 
virtually all companies, so while Climate Bonds may not advocate 
that every SLB should have climate mitigation KPIs/targets, all 
issuers should have at least one outstanding SLB containing this.

due to the funnel approach described.
