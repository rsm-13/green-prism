FRAMEWORK UPDATED IN NOVEMBER 2021
SG’s Sustainable and Positive Impact Bond framework allows issuance from various entities of the group: SG SA, SG SFH, SG country branches, 
etc., and is:
✓ fully aligned with the UNEP FI’s Principles for Positive Impact Finance (PPIF) and its Assessment Framework
✓ fully aligned with the ICMA’s Green Bond Principles, Social Bond Principles and Sustainability Bond Guidelines
✓ and designed to take into consideration the EU Taxonomy requirements, on a best effort basis
This Framework has been reviewed by ISS Corporate Solutions who published a Second Party Opinion confirming these alignments                                                   
with the PPIF, the ICMA Principles and the EU Taxonomy (on green eligible activities, including against the DNSH for two sample categories)
The set up of a single Sustainable and Positive Impact Bond Framework outlines the Group’s holistic approach, with a view to increase the 
volume and the diversity of eligible activities, green but also social
• ICMA Green Categories : Renewable energy, Green buildings, Clean Transportation, Water management and Water treatment, Circular 
Economy, Pollution prevention and control
• ICMA Social Categories : Employment generation and preservation through SME financing, Socioeconomic advancement and empowerment, 
Affordable housing, Access to education and professional training and Access to healthcare
A single and 
broad 
Framework
following best 
market

✓ Société Générale has robust E&S policies and risk management systems, notably through the application of the Equator Principles and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards 
and Environment, Health and Safety Guidelines for the assessment of E&S risks.
✓ In addition, through the Positive Impact Evaluation, both positive and negative E&S impacts are assessed. Only projects with well managed negative impacts combined with positive ones are at the end 
“positive impact”. This holistic approach is conceptually aligned with the one followed by the EU Taxonomy

In line with the EU Taxonomy, the issuer clearly described in its framework:
• The Substantial Contribution of the Green eligible categories to Climate Change mitigation
• Selection criteria in line with the Technical Screening Criteria applicable to relevant activities. Additionally, Société Générale provided ISS ESG with more information on its selection process. 
According to ISS ESG assessment, this process aligns with the Minimum Social Safeguards for all Green categories and with the Do No Significant Harm criteria for two sample categories*
*For a sample of categories, ISS ESG conducted an in-depth review of the selection of green activity categories against the EU Taxonomy activity specific requirements. Due to the limited engagement period with the issuer, ISS ESG could not conduct 
a detailed review of the alignment of all green activities considered under this framework with the EU Taxonomy. You can consult ISS ESG's more detailed DNSH analysis for Production of Electricity from Solar PV and Production of Electricity from Wind

• In alignment with UNEP FI’s Principles for Positive Impact Finance, 
eligible loans to SG SFH’s Positive Covered Bonds have been selected 
for their clear positive contribution to Climate and their support to 
the transition to a low carbon future
• Therefore, they directly contribute to achieving the following United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals:
Target 7.3 By 2030, double the global rate of 
improvement in energy efficiency
UN SDG 13 consists in taking urgent action to combat 
climate change and its impacts. Financing Green buildings 
can contribute to this goal, as it contributes to the 
reduction of GHG emissions compared to energy 
production based on fossil fuels and to the development 
of carbon-intensive buildings
 In alignment with UNEP FI’s Principles for Positive Impact Finance, a 
review of potential negative impacts mitigation actions and an analysis 
of other positive externalities has been performed (cf. slides 28 & 29)
• Positive contribution to Climate is essentially measured based on the 
following metrics: 
• Estimated ex-ante annual energy savings (in MWh) 
• Annual GHG emissions in tons of CO2 equivalent saved

OTHER EXTERNALITIES ASSESSMENT (1/2)
Identification of other positive externalities and mitigation of potential negative impacts
By targeting mortgages on main 
residences only, the Sustainable and 
Positive Impact Bond promotes 
residences’ primary use: housing. 
Secondary residences are excluded 
because of their impact on real estate 
market prices which could create 
barriers for property acquisition by local 
residents. 
The exclusion of any secondary 
residences limits the impact on land 
artificialization and its consequences on 
soil and biodiversity erosion is limited. 
By supporting access to multi-family 
dwellings, Sustainable and Positive 
Impact bonds contribute to reducing the 
soil area’s construction rate (the share 
of multi-family dwellings is higher than 
the share of single-family dwellings in 
the eligible portfolio).

Access to public transportation
The average carbon footprint of a French citizen is 
annually estimated by the Bureau of Ecological 
Transition and the ADEME. Nowadays, it is estimated 
around 9,3 tCO2eq/year. Amongst the emissions 
sources, the car usage is the main emission source 
with 1,8 tCO2eq/year per person, with 7 French 
citizens out of 10 taking their car to go to work each 
day. Car usage is the more emissive transportation 
mean on a daily basis with regard to its usage per 
person and per travelled kilometer.
For this reason, reducing car use is at the center of the 
national priorities with regards to the goals 
established by the national carbon reduction strategy 
(SNBC). 
Car use is related to the travel distance between the 
home location and the working place. It is also 
correlated to the availability of public transportation 
services. Thanks to 1990’s voluntary mobility policies 
in largest cities, car use represents 51.7% of the 
modal share, compared to 68% in medium-sized 
towns. Main residences located in largest towns 
therefore allow a car use decrease. 
A large proportion of the portfolio of Eligible Loans 
finances the acquisition new multi-family properties 
located in the largest cities, more likely to be 
connected to public transportation

Step 3 :

Project scenario Life-cycle emissions including use phase, vehicle manufacturing, vehicle end-of-life, infrastructure

Reference 
scenario
Life-cycle emissions (use phase, vehicle manufacturing, vehicle end-of-life, infrastructure 
construction) of the modal mix that would exist without the project. The total number of pkm or tkm 
is the same as in the reference scenario. The reference modal mix is specific (city, country concerned) 
whenever possible or generic (ex average urban modal mix) if no information is available. All

LOW CARBON TRANSPORT – TERRESTRIAL TRANSPORT - 
ALLOCATION TO SOCIÉTÉ GÉNÉRALE
Step. 2.
Rolling stock/ 
infrastructure 
attribution 
Some projects only concern one part of the “transport system” (project loan or investment that concern either 
only the rolling stock or only the transport infrastructure) but not both . While both are necessary for the 
operation of the system and while  both require substantial capital, having no allocation factor (for example 
allocating to the rolling stock  100% of all emission avoided by a project) would mean that, per euro invested, 
investing in rolling stock would generate far more avoided emissions than investing in infrastructure. To correct 
this bias, an attribution factor is applied based on the type of asset (train, metro, etc.).  This approach can be 
seen as conservative as it reduces the total level of avoided emissions claimed by Société Générale.
Step 3. 
Financial 
attribution 
The resulting avoided emissions are allocated as a proportion of the share of SG’s investment out of the total 
debt and equity. The detailed calculation is directly based on the PCAF rules for allocating induced emissions.

NZBA PORTFOLIO ALIGNMENT TARGETS (2/2)
(1) The cement industry is a hard-to-abate sector and will require technologies that are not mature enough to accelerate its decarbonization by 2030, (2) Emissions 
generated during: (i) operational activities (i.e., Scope 1, or tank-to-wake emissions for shipowners) from fuel combustion on board of a vessel (ii) upstream activities (i.e., 
Scope 3 category 3, or well-to-tank emissions for shipowners) including extraction, cultivation, production, processing, storage, transport and bunkering of fuels, (3) The 
target translates into an AER reduction of 43% in 2030 vs 2022 (vs. 39% industry), (4) The target has been determined using the Pegasus Guidelines and depends on SG’s 
portfolio mix of cargo / passenger. An alignment of the portfolio with a 1.5°C trajectory would have led to an intensity target of 781 gCO2e/RTK.

SOCIETE GENERALE DUAL-TRANCHE EUR 1BN LONG 2Y FXD & EUR 
1BN 6NC5 GREEN POSITIVE IMPACT SENIOR NON-PREFERRED
07th November 2024
Rationale of the transaction
◼ In this post US election environment, Société Générale decided to seize this 
narrow window, ahead of the FOMC meeting scheduled on that day, to make its 
comeback in the public market since March 2024 with a new EUR dual-tranche 
SNP
◼ SG decided to return to the markets after solid Q3 results, marked by a surge in 
its domestic retail profit thanks to a rebound in NII, and after announcing key 
changes in its executive ranks
◼ Société Générale has already fully completed its 2024 funding program (revised 
to 17-18bn from 20-22bn), both the Long 2Y and the 6NC5 Green Positive Impact 
SNP are therefore part of SG’s 2025 prefunding
◼ The books opened at 9:10am CET with IPTs released at MS+105bp area for the 
Long 2Y tranche and MS+170bp area for the 6NC5 Green Positive Impact tranche
◼ Books continued to grow strongly, and at 1:05pm CET SG was able to set size at 
EUR 1bn for each tranche, and final spreads at MS+78bp for the Long 2Y and 
MS+135bp for the 6NC5 Green Positive Impact, on the back of a demand above 
EUR 2.4bn+ and EUR 4.7bn+ respectively
◼ Société Générale successfully priced its new dual-tranche EUR 1bn Long 
2Y FXD and EUR 1bn 6NC5 Green Positive Impact SNP transaction, 
tightening the spread by 27bp and 35bp respectively from IPTs to final 
spreads:
◼ The bonds attracted a wide range of investors, with a final combined 
orderbook above EUR 5.5bn with more than 190 investors allocated: 
➢ By geography, French accounts amounted to 28% for the Long 2Y 
FXD, while UK/Irish investors were well represented in both deals 
(22% and 38% resp.)
➢ By investor type, Asset Managers took the lion’s share with c. 70% 
allocated, followed by Insurers (14% for the Green 6NC5) and CB/OI 
(16% for the L2Y)

Project Description:  Serrano is a vast solar and energy storage project located in Pima and Pinal 
Counties of Arizona (USA), that is already operational.
Positive impacts

The project marks an important milestone in advancing the state’s renewable energy capabilities as it 
will have capacity to power roughly 61,000 homes, representing over 330,000 metric tons of CO 2 
emissions avoided annually, and will support grid reliability, particularly during Arizona’s hot summer 
months.
Negative impacts and their mitigations 
ENVIRONMENT – Biodiversity
Accounting for the potential occurrence of some protected species in the vicinity of the site area, the 
Project  committed to apply best management practices throughout construction to minimize 
environmental impact, including by training workers to stop construction work if any potential resources 
are found and by conducting mitigation measures as appropriate.
