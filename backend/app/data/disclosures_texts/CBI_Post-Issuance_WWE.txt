Scope and Objectives 
San Francisco Public Utilities Commission  (SFPUC) has issued green bonds aimed at financing or 
refinancing projects within the Sewer System Improvement Program ( SSIP) under a programmatic 
agreement with Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) since May 2018 . In 2023, SFPUC engaged 
Sustainalytics to review the projects financed between August 2018 and October 2023 with proceeds 
from the SFPUC Green Bonds (the “Nominated Projects”) and provide an assessment as to whether 
the Nominated Projects meet the Post-Issuance Requirements of the Climate Bonds Standard.1 
Green bonds include:2 
• Wastewater Revenue Bonds (Green Bonds) 2018 Series A 
• Wastewater Revenue Bonds (Green Bonds) 2018 Series C  
• Wastewater Revenue Bonds (Green Bonds) 2021 Series A 
• Wastewater Revenue Bonds (Green Notes) 2021 Series A 
• Wastewater Revenue Bonds (Green Notes) 2021 Series B 
• Wastewater Revenue Bonds (Green Bonds) 2023 Series A

• Part C: Requirements for Specific Bond Types - Part C requirements shall be met to be 
eligible for post -issuance certification and are used selectively, depending on the type of 
bond in question. 
Issuing Entity’s Responsibility  
SFPUC is responsible for providing accurate information and documentation relating to the details 
of projects, including description, total development cost of each project and disbursed amounts. 
Independence and Quality Control  
Sustainalytics, a leading provider of ESG and corporate governance research and ratings to investors, 
conducted the verification of the SFPUC Green Bonds  to provide an independent opinion on its  
conformance with the Post-Issuance Requirements of the Climate Bonds Standard. 
Sustainalytics has relied on the information and the facts presented by SFPUC with respect to the 
Nominated Projects. Sustainalytics is not responsible nor shall it be held liable for any inaccuracies 
in the opinions, findings or conclusions herein due to incorrect or incomplete data provided by 
SFPUC.  
Sustainalytics makes all efforts to ensure the highest quality and rigor during its assessment process 
and enlisted its Sustainability Bonds Review Committee to provide oversight over this assessment. 
Verifier’s Responsibility 
Sustainalytics conducted the verification in accordance with the Climate Bonds Standard Version 2.1 
and with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000). 
The work undertaken as part of this engagement included conversations with relevant SFPUC 
employees and review of relevant documentation to assess conformance of the SFPUC Green Bonds 
with the Post-Issuance Requirements of the Climate Bonds Standard Version 2.1. 
Exceptions 
No exceptions were identified. All projects meet the Post -Issuance Requirements of the Climate 
Bonds Standard Version 2.1 and the Water Infrastructure criteria. 
Conclusion 
Based on the limited assurance procedures conducted and evidence obtained, nothing has come to 
Sustainalytics’ attention that causes us to believe that, in all material respects, the allocation of the 
following SFPUC Green Bonds , issued to fund eligible green water infrastructure,  is not in 
conformance with the Post-Issuance Requirements of the Climate Bonds Standard: 
 
• USD 241,017,855 from 2018 Series A (Green Bonds) 
• USD 170,720,000 from 2018 Series C (Green Bonds) 
• USD 296,000,000 from 2021 Series A (Green Bonds) 
• USD 220,000,000 from 2021 Series A (Green Notes) 
• USD 130,000,000 from 2021 Series B (Green Notes) 
• USD 556,696,799 from 2023 Series A (Green Bonds) 
• USD 170,720,000 from 2023 Series C (Green Bonds)
