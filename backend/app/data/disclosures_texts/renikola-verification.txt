CORPORATE PROFILE AND OBJECTIVES  
reNIKOLA Solar II Sdn Bhd (reNIKOLA Solar II or the Issuer) is a wholly owned subsidiary of reNIKOLA Holdings Sdn Bhd 
(reNIKOLA or the Group). reNIKOLA Solar II was incorporated on 26 October 2021 to raise funds for the refinancing of 
two solar photovoltaic (PV) plants in Malaysia under their wholly owned subsidiaries, BGMC Bras Power Sdn Bhd 
(BBPSB) and Idiwan Solar Sdn Bhd ( ISSB), (collectively, the Project Companies ). reNIKOLA is an investment holding 
company principally engaged in the renewable energy (RE) industry. The Group aims to expand its business in the RE 
industry through organic growth and targeted strategic acquisitions, and currently has a portfolio of large -scale solar 
(LSS), biogas and hydro power plants in operation and/or under development. 
 
reNIKOLA has established a Green Financing Framework (the Framework), with the intention to document the Group’s 
sustainable financing approach, facilitate the broadening of investments into other renewable energy sources, and 
contribute towards a low -carbon and climate-resilient future. Through this Framework, reNIKOLA may issue various 
green financing including, green sukuk, green bonds, and green loans, for allocation to eligible investments. The first 
issuance under the Framework is reNIKOLA Solar II’s issuance of Islamic medium-term notes of up to RM390 million in 
nominal value (the reNIKOLA II ASEAN Green SRI Sukuk or the Green Sukuk). 
 
The proceeds of the Green Sukuk will be used to partially finance/reimburse the total development costs incurred for 
two solar PV power plants (collectively, the Solar Plants) located in Kuala Muda, Kedah and Machang, Kelantan, as well 
as the costs relating to the issuance.  
SCOPE 
RAM Sustainability has been appointed as an Approved Verifier to review and verify that reNIKOLA Solar II’s Green 
Sukuk meets the Pre-Issuance Requirements under the Climate Bonds Standard. The reNIKOLA II ASEAN Green SRI 
Sukuk is expected to be the first Climate Bonds Certified Green Sukuk in Malaysia , and the world . The engagement 
with reNIKOLA Solar II took place from June to July 2023. 
CRITERIA 
Relevant Climate Bonds Standard and Sector Criteria for this Climate Bonds Certification are: 
  
(i)  Climate Bonds Standard (Version 4)1  
(ii) Solar Sector Criteria (Version 2.3) 
  
ISSUER’S RESPONSIBILITY

(iv) The commitments for reporting prior to issuance, such as investment areas, methodology for impact reporting 
and frequency of periodic assurance engagements 
 
VERIFIER’S RESPONSIBILITY 
The work undertaken as part of this engagement included discussions with key reNIKOLA employees and review of 
relevant documentation to confirm that the Green Sukuk is in line with the Climate Bonds Standard Pre-Issuance 
Requirements, which include conformance to:

Engagements 3000 – Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Information’s  limited 
assurance procedures. 
 
INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL

BASIS OF THE OPINION 
RAM Sustainability conducted the verification in accordance with the Climate Bonds Standard Version 4 and with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 – Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Information.  
 
RAM Sustainability  planned a nd performed the verification by obtaining evidence and other information and

SRI Sukuk meets the requirements of the Climate Bonds Standard.  
 
CONCLUSION

causes us to believe that, in all material respects, the reNIKOLA II ASEAN Green SRI Sukuk is not in conformance with 
the Climate Bonds Standard’s Pre-Issuance Requirements.
