ING commissioned ISS-oekom to compile a Verification Report for Pre-Issuance Certification of its Green 
Bond by the Climate Bond s Initiative (CBI). The Climate Bond s Certification process includes  verifying 
whether the provisions of the Climate Bonds Standard issued by the CBI are met and obtaining evidence 
to support the verification.  
 
Relevant CBI Standards for this Climate Bonds Certification:  
• Climate Bonds Standard (Version 2.1) 
• Wind – Sector Criteria ( Version 1.1) 
• Solar – Sector Criteria (V ersion 2.1) 
• Residential and Commercial Buildings Methodologies  (Version 1.0) 
• Marine Renewable Energy Sector Eligibility Criteria  (status 10/2017)  
 
 
ING’s responsibility was to provide information and documentation on:  
• Selection of nominated projects & assets 
• Internal processes & controls 
• (Proposed) reporting

ISS-oekom reviewed the information and documentation provided and developed by ING to assess the 
Green Bond’s alignment with the CBI requirements:  
• Conformance with the selection of nominated projects & assets requirements  
• Conformance with the internal processes & controls requirements  
• Conformance with the reporting requirements   
 
ISS-oekom’s approach to assess whether the issuer meets the criteria of the CBI standard was as 
follows: 
 
• The issuer provided an overview over the assets to be included in the Green Bond asset pool 
and the relevant  processes regarding the proceeds (e.g. use of proceeds,  management of 
proceeds) to ISS -oekom.  
• The issuer filled in a questionnaire that covers all  criteria of the Climate Bond s Standard 2.1.  
• The issuer provided background documents that elaborate further on the information 
mentioned in the questionnaire.  
• Using the questionnaire and back ground documents, ISS -oekom carried out a n assessment 
of the CBI criteria. In case any answers were unclear, ISS-oekom contacted the issuer for more 
details and clarification.  
 
 
This Verification Report for Climate Bond s Certification is intended for the use of ING and the Climate 
Bonds Standard Board. CBI and ISS-oekom agree to only publish the report with the consent of ING.  
 
 
 
Based on the limited assurance procedures conducted and evidence obtained , nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that, in all mat erial respects the Issuer’s 2018 Green  Bond is not in 
conformance with the Climate Bonds Standard’s Pre -Issuance Requirements.
