# Green Prism MVP

Green bond transparency & impact predictor.

## Structure

- backend/  – FastAPI API, ML scoring, data loaders
- frontend/ – React web app

This repo is just a scaffold. You still need to:
- install dependencies (Python + Node)
- wire up FastAPI / React code
- add real ML models & data.
